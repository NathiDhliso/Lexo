# Ticker Improvements - Live Data & Better Alignment

## Changes Made

### 1. Live Data Integration ✅

**File: `src/services/ticker-data.service.ts`**

Replaced mock data with live data from your database:

- **Matter Deadlines**: Shows upcoming deadlines from matters within the next 30 days
  - Urgent (red): 3 days or less
  - Attention (amber): 4-7 days
  - Normal (green): 8-30 days

- **Overdue Invoices**: Shows all invoices with OVERDUE status
  - Urgent (red): More than 30 days overdue
  - Attention (amber): Less than 30 days overdue

- **Payment Due Soon**: Shows SENT invoices due within 7 days
  - Urgent (red): Due in 2 days or less
  - Attention (amber): Due in 3-7 days

**Features:**
- Automatically fetches data from matters and invoices
- Sorts by urgency and date
- Limits to top 10 most important items
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Uses current user's data from localStorage

### 2. Improved Text Alignment & Spacing ✅

**File: `src/components/navigation/RealTimeTicker.tsx`**

Fixed the squashed text appearance:

**Main Ticker Bar:**
- Increased height from `h-12` to `h-14` for better breathing room
- Added `py-2` padding for vertical spacing
- Increased icon margin from `mr-3` to `mr-4`
- Changed title font from `text-sm` to `text-base` and made it `font-semibold`
- Increased description text from `text-xs` to `text-sm`
- Changed gap between elements from `gap-2/gap-4` to `gap-3/gap-6`
- Made time/amount text larger and more readable
- Increased navigation arrow size and spacing

**Progress Indicators:**
- Moved from `bottom-1` to `bottom-2` for better positioning
- Increased dot size from `w-1.5 h-1.5` to `w-2 h-2`
- Increased gap between dots from `gap-1` to `gap-1.5`

**Hover Overlay:**
- Increased max height from `max-h-64` to `max-h-80`
- Added `gap-4` between elements in each row
- Increased padding from `p-3` to `p-4`
- Made titles `font-semibold` instead of `font-medium`
- Increased description text from `text-xs` to `text-sm`
- Added `mb-1` margin between title and description
- Made amounts and times more prominent with better spacing

## Testing

To test the ticker:

1. **Create test data:**
   - Add matters with `expected_completion_date` within the next 30 days
   - Create invoices with OVERDUE status
   - Create invoices with SENT status and due dates within 7 days

2. **Verify display:**
   - Ticker should show real data from your database
   - Text should be properly spaced and readable
   - Colors should indicate urgency (red/amber/green)
   - Hover to see all ticker items

3. **Check auto-refresh:**
   - Ticker updates every 30 seconds automatically
   - Items rotate every 4 seconds when not hovered

## Visual Improvements

- ✅ Better vertical spacing - no more squashed text
- ✅ Larger, more readable fonts
- ✅ Proper gaps between elements
- ✅ Better icon alignment
- ✅ More prominent amounts and dates
- ✅ Cleaner hover overlay
- ✅ Better progress indicators

## Data Flow

```
User Login → localStorage stores user data
    ↓
Ticker Component mounts
    ↓
tickerDataService.getTickerItems()
    ↓
Fetches from:
- matterApiService.getByAdvocate() → Matter deadlines
- InvoiceService.getInvoices() → Overdue & due soon invoices
    ↓
Sorts by urgency & date
    ↓
Returns top 10 items
    ↓
Displays in ticker with proper styling
    ↓
Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
```

## Notes

- The ticker will be empty if there are no upcoming deadlines or overdue invoices
- All data is filtered to the current logged-in user
- Clicking on ticker items navigates to the appropriate page (/matters or /invoices)
- The minimize/maximize button allows users to collapse the ticker to save space
