# Build Fixes Applied - January 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Path Error in KeyboardShortcutsHelp.tsx ✅
**Error:** `Failed to resolve import "../hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts"`

**Fix:** Updated import path from `../hooks/` to `../../hooks/`
```typescript
// Before
import { getKeyboardShortcutLabel, type KeyboardShortcut } from '../hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts';

// After
import { getKeyboardShortcutLabel, type KeyboardShortcut } from '../../hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts';
```

**File:** `src/components/ui/KeyboardShortcutsHelp.tsx`

---

### 2. Missing Export in ui/index.ts ✅
**Error:** `Could not resolve "../animations/Transitions" from "src/components/ui/index.ts"`

**Root Cause:** The `src/components/animations/` directory was deleted during cleanup, but the export statement remained in the index file.

**Fix:** Removed the export statement for deleted Transitions component
```typescript
// Removed this line:
export * from '../animations/Transitions';
```

**File:** `src/components/ui/index.ts`
