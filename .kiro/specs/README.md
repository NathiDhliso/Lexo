Complete one feature fully before starting the next.  
**Timeline**: 10-14 weeks

### Strategy 2: Parallel (Two Developers)
Two developers work on different features simultaneously.  
**Timeline**: 8 weeks

### Strategy 3: MVP First (Recommended)
Build core functionality for all features quickly, then iterate.  
**Timeline**: 6 weeks for MVPs, then polish
