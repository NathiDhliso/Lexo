# LexoHub Feature Roadmap - Complete Spec Summary

## Overview

This document provides a complete overview of all feature specs created for LexoHub's product roadmap. The roadmap is organized into phases that progressively build user engagement, expand the user base, and enhance the ecosystem.

**Total Specs Created**: 5 complete feature specs  
**Total Estimated Effort**: 16-20 weeks  
**Status**: All specs complete and ready for implementation

---

## Phase 1: Secure Daily User Engagement

**Goal**: Make LexoHub a "can't live without it" tool for solo advocates' core daily tasks.

### ✅ 1. Smart Document Linking

**Location**: `.kiro/specs/smart-document-linking/`  
**Status**: Complete - Ready for Implementation  
**Priority**: High - Core Workflow  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

**Problem**: Advocates experience friction between LexoHub (billing/matter management) and their document storage systems (case files), requiring constant app-switching.

**Solution**: Allow advocates to link external documents (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, local files) directly to matters without building a full document management system.

**Key Features**:
- Link documents from any cloud storage or local files
- Organize with categories, tags, and search
- Bulk add multiple documents
- Quick access from matter cards
- Integration with time entries and invoices
- Mobile-responsive design

**Success Metrics**:
- 70%+ adoption within first week
- Average 5+ documents per active matter
- 30% increase in daily active users
- 50% reduction in app-switching time

**Implementation Highlights**:
- New `matter_document_links` database table
- Metadata-only storage (no file hosting)
- 16 major tasks, 40+ sub-tasks
- Complete API service layer
- React components with hooks

### ✅ 2. Retainer Management UI

**Location**: `.kiro/specs/retainer-management-ui/`  
**Status**: Complete - Ready for Implementation  
**Priority**: High - Core Financial Management  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks (2 weeks for core)  
**Backend**: ✅ Already Complete

**Problem**: LexoHub has complete backend for retainer management, but no user interface to access it, creating a gap in financial management for advocates tracking client deposits.

**Solution**: Build comprehensive UI layer to make existing retainer functionality accessible and intuitive.

**Key Features**:
- Create retainer agreements with visual balance indicators
- Record deposits and apply to invoices
- Transaction history with export
- Dashboard widgets for overview
- Low balance and expiring alerts
- Automatic retainer application during invoice generation
- Mobile-responsive design

**Success Metrics**:
- 60%+ adoption within first month
- 80% reduction in manual tracking time
- 30% increase in timely invoice payments
- 90% ease-of-use rating

**Implementation Highlights**:
- Backend already exists (RetainerService, database tables)
- Focus on UI/UX layer only
- 15 major tasks, 50+ sub-tasks
- Custom React hooks for data management
- Integration with invoice workflow

---

## Phase 2: Expand User Base & Core Functionality

**Goal**: Remove barriers for new users and add features for small-scale collaboration.

### ✅ 3. CSV Import Tool

**Location**: `.kiro/specs/csv-import-tool/`  
**Status**: Complete - Ready for Implementation  
**Priority**: High - User Growth  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 weeks (3 weeks for core)

**Problem**: Established advocates have dozens or hundreds of contacts in spreadsheets. Manually entering each contact is time-consuming and frustrating, often causing advocates to abandon onboarding.

**Solution**: 7-step wizard for importing clients and attorneys from CSV files, with validation, duplicate detection, and rollback capabilities.

**Key Features**:
- Separate import flows for clients and attorneys
- CSV file upload with validation
- Intelligent column mapping with auto-detection
- Comprehensive data validation
- Duplicate detection with resolution options
- Preview before import with detailed summary
- Batch processing for large imports
- Import history and rollback (within 24 hours)

**Success Metrics**:
- 80%+ of new advocates use CSV import
- 90%+ reduction in contact setup time
- 85%+ of imports complete successfully
- 95%+ of imported records valid
- 60%+ reduction in onboarding support tickets

**Implementation Highlights**:
- New `import_history` database table
- 7-step wizard with React components
- Papa Parse library for CSV parsing
- 19 major tasks, 60+ sub-tasks
- Complete validation and error handling

### ✅ 4. Calendar Integration

**Location**: `.kiro/specs/calendar-integration/`  
**Status**: Complete - Ready for Implementation  
**Priority**: Medium - User Growth  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks (1 week for core)  
**Backend**: ❌ Not Required - All Client-Side

**Problem**: Advocates must manually transfer deadlines from LexoHub to their personal calendars, creating friction and increasing risk of missed deadlines.

**Solution**: Simple "Add to Calendar" buttons that generate universal .ics files working with all calendar applications.

**Key Features**:
- Add court dates, deadlines, and meetings to calendar
- Bulk export upcoming deadlines
- Customizable reminder settings
- Detailed event descriptions with links back to LexoHub
- Mobile support (iOS and Android)
- Standards-compliant .ics file generation (RFC 5545)

**Success Metrics**:
- 70%+ adoption within first month
- 5+ calendar exports per advocate per week
- 20% reduction in missed deadlines
- 80% reduction in time spent on calendar entry
- <5% compatibility issues

**Implementation Highlights**:
- All client-side implementation
- No backend work required
- ICSGeneratorService utility class
- 16 major tasks, 45+ sub-tasks
- Works with Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar

### ⏳ 5. Secretary/Admin Role (Not Yet Spec'd)

**Priority**: Medium - User Growth  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

**Problem**: Solo advocates with support staff need to give them access to billing functions without full system access.

**Solution**: Single additional user role with access to financial sections (Pro Formas, Invoices, Payments) but not core matter details.

**Status**: Spec not yet created - would be next priority
