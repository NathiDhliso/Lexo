# Smart Document Linking Feature Spec

## Overview

This spec defines the Smart Document Linking feature for LexoHub - a Phase 1 priority feature that transforms LexoHub into the central dashboard for advocates by allowing them to link external documents (from Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or local storage) directly to matters.

## Problem Statement

Solo advocates currently experience friction between LexoHub (for billing/matter management) and their document storage systems (for case files). This disconnect reduces the likelihood of LexoHub becoming their primary workspace and requires constant app-switching.

## Solution

Smart Document Linking allows advocates to link external documents to matters without building a full document management system. This low-friction approach:
- Stores only metadata and links, not actual files
- Leverages existing storage solutions
- Makes LexoHub the central hub for all matter-related information
- Increases daily user engagement

## Spec Documents

1. **[requirements.md](./requirements.md)** - Complete requirements with user stories and acceptance criteria in EARS format
2. **[design.md](./design.md)** - Comprehensive technical design including architecture, database schema, components, and API specifications
3. **[tasks.md](./tasks.md)** - Detailed implementation plan with 16 major tasks broken into 40+ actionable sub-tasks

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- Link documents from any cloud storage or local files to matters
- Organize documents with categories, tags, and descriptions
- Search and filter documents by multiple criteria
- Bulk add multiple document links at once
- Track document access for analytics

### Integration Points
- Matter detail page with dedicated Documents section
- Matter list cards with document count indicators and quick preview
- Time entry form with optional document linking
- Invoice generation with document attachment
- Audit trail logging for all document operations

### User Experience
- Mobile-responsive design with touch gestures
- Quick access from matter cards without navigation
- Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
- Comprehensive error handling with recovery options
- Empty states with clear calls-to-action

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: 70%+ of active users link at least one document within first week
- **Engagement**: Average of 5+ document links per active matter
- **Retention**: 30% increase in daily active users within 30 days
- **Efficiency**: 50%+ reduction in time spent switching between applications
- **Satisfaction**: NPS increase of 15+ points post-launch

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)
- Database schema and migrations
- Basic CRUD API service
- Document list and management components
- Matter detail page integration
- Basic search and filtering

### Phase 2: Enhanced UX
- Bulk add functionality
- Quick preview from matter cards
- Advanced filtering
- Mobile optimization

### Phase 3: Workflow Integration
- Time entry linking
- Invoice document attachment
- Audit trail integration
- Matter activity timeline

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Document access analytics
- Duplicate detection
- Broken link detection
- Export capabilities

## Technical Stack

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) with RLS policies
- **Backend**: Supabase API with custom service layer
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Query or SWR for data fetching
- **UI Components**: Existing LexoHub design system
- **Mobile**: Responsive design with touch optimization

## Getting Started

To begin implementing this feature:

1. Review the [requirements.md](./requirements.md) to understand user needs
2. Study the [design.md](./design.md) for technical architecture
3. Follow the [tasks.md](./tasks.md) implementation plan sequentially
4. Start with Task 1 (Database schema) and work through incrementally

## Dependencies

- Existing LexoHub authentication system
- Supabase database and RLS policies
- BaseApiService for consistent API patterns
- Existing UI component library
- Audit trail system for logging

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for MVP)

- OAuth integration with cloud storage providers
- In-app document preview
- Document version control
- Collaboration features (comments, sharing)
- Advanced search with OCR
- Automated document categorization with AI
