# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Smart Document Linking feature addresses a critical pain point for solo advocates: the disconnect between billing/matter management in LexoHub and case files stored in external systems (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, local storage). Currently, advocates must switch between LexoHub and their file storage to access case documents, creating friction and reducing the likelihood of LexoHub becoming their central workspace.

This feature transforms LexoHub into a true "matter dashboard" by allowing advocates to link external documents directly to matters. Rather than building a full document management system (which would be resource-intensive and compete with established solutions), this approach leverages existing storage solutions while making LexoHub the central hub for accessing all matter-related information.

The primary goal is to increase daily user engagement by making LexoHub indispensable for the advocate's core workflow: managing matters with quick access to all related documents and billing information in one place.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Link External Documents to Matters

**User Story:** As a solo advocate, I want to link documents from my existing cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive) or local files to specific matters, so that I can access all matter-related information from one central location without switching between multiple applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a matter detail page THEN the system SHALL display a "Documents" section with options to add document links
2. WHEN the user clicks "Add Document Link" THEN the system SHALL provide options to link from: URL/Web Link, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or upload a reference to a local file path
3. WHEN adding a document link THEN the system SHALL require a document name and allow optional fields for: document type/category, description, and tags
4. WHEN a document link is saved THEN the system SHALL store the link metadata (name, type, URL/path, description, tags, date added) in the database associated with the matter
5. WHEN viewing the Documents section THEN the system SHALL display all linked documents with their name, type, date added, and description
6. WHEN the user clicks on a document link THEN the system SHALL open the document in a new tab/window using the stored URL or path
7. IF a document link is no longer accessible THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message without breaking the interface

### Requirement 2: Organize and Categorize Documents

**User Story:** As a solo advocate managing multiple document types per matter (pleadings, correspondence, evidence, contracts), I want to categorize and organize my document links, so that I can quickly find the specific documents I need without scrolling through an unorganized list.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding or editing a document link THEN the system SHALL provide predefined document categories: Pleadings, Correspondence, Evidence, Contracts, Court Orders, Client Documents, Billing Documents, Other
2. WHEN viewing the Documents section THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by document category
3. WHEN viewing the Documents section THEN the system SHALL allow sorting by: date added (newest/oldest), name (A-Z/Z-A), or document type
4. WHEN adding a document link THEN the system SHALL allow the user to add multiple tags for flexible organization
5. WHEN viewing the Documents section THEN the system SHALL display a search box that filters documents by name, description, or tags in real-time
6. WHEN multiple documents are linked THEN the system SHALL display them in a clean, scannable list or card view with key metadata visible

### Requirement 3: Quick Access from Matter List

**User Story:** As a solo advocate reviewing my active matters, I want to see at a glance which matters have linked documents and quickly access them, so that I can efficiently navigate to the information I need without opening each matter individually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the matters list THEN the system SHALL display a document icon/indicator on matter cards that have linked documents
2. WHEN hovering over the document indicator THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip with the count of linked documents (e.g., "5 documents")
3. WHEN clicking the document indicator from the matter card THEN the system SHALL provide a quick preview/dropdown of the most recent 3-5 document links
4. WHEN clicking a document link in the quick preview THEN the system SHALL open that document directly without navigating to the full matter detail page
5. WHEN viewing a matter card with linked documents THEN the system SHALL display the most recently added document name as a quick reference

### Requirement 4: Bulk Document Linking

**User Story:** As a solo advocate setting up a new matter with existing case files, I want to add multiple document links at once, so that I can efficiently organize my existing documents without repetitive manual entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in the Documents section THEN the system SHALL provide a "Bulk Add Links" option
2. WHEN using bulk add THEN the system SHALL allow the user to paste multiple URLs (one per line) and assign a common category and tags to all
3. WHEN using bulk add THEN the system SHALL validate each URL and display any errors before saving
4. WHEN bulk adding is complete THEN the system SHALL display a success message with the count of documents added
5. IF some URLs fail validation during bulk add THEN the system SHALL save the valid ones and report which URLs failed with specific error messages

### Requirement 5: Document Link Management

**User Story:** As a solo advocate maintaining matter records over time, I want to edit, remove, or update document links as my case files change or move, so that my matter dashboard remains accurate and useful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a document link THEN the system SHALL provide options to: Edit, Delete, or Copy Link
2. WHEN editing a document link THEN the system SHALL allow updating: name, URL/path, category, description, and tags
3. WHEN deleting a document link THEN the system SHALL require confirmation before removal
4. WHEN a document link is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove it from the database and update the matter's document count immediately
5. WHEN copying a document link THEN the system SHALL copy the full URL/path to the clipboard and display a confirmation message
6. WHEN editing or deleting documents THEN the system SHALL log the action in the audit trail with user and timestamp

### Requirement 6: Integration with Matter Workflow

**User Story:** As a solo advocate working on a matter, I want document links to be integrated into my existing LexoHub workflow (pro formas, invoices, time entries), so that I can seamlessly reference documents while performing billing and matter management tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a time entry THEN the system SHALL allow optionally linking to a related document from the matter's document list
2. WHEN viewing a time entry with a linked document THEN the system SHALL display a clickable link to that document
3. WHEN generating an invoice or pro forma THEN the system SHALL allow the user to optionally attach/reference specific documents from the matter
4. WHEN viewing matter activity/timeline THEN the system SHALL include document link additions as timeline events
5. WHEN a document is linked to a time entry or invoice THEN the system SHALL display this relationship in the document's metadata

### Requirement 7: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a solo advocate handling confidential client information, I want document links to respect my firm's security practices, so that sensitive case files remain protected and only accessible to authorized users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing document links THEN the system SHALL store only metadata and URLs/paths, never the actual document content
2. WHEN accessing a document link THEN the system SHALL rely on the external storage provider's authentication and permissions
3. WHEN a user without matter access attempts to view documents THEN the system SHALL deny access consistent with matter-level permissions
4. IF implementing future multi-user features THEN the system SHALL respect role-based access to document links (e.g., Secretary/Admin role)
5. WHEN displaying document links THEN the system SHALL not expose full file paths in the UI for local file references, only the filename
6. WHEN a document link is accessed THEN the system SHALL log the access in the audit trail for compliance purposes

### Requirement 8: Mobile and Responsive Access

**User Story:** As a solo advocate who often works from my phone or tablet, I want to access and manage document links from any device, so that I can reference case files while in court, meeting with clients, or working remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Documents section on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout optimized for smaller screens
2. WHEN adding a document link on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a simplified form with essential fields easily accessible
3. WHEN clicking a document link on mobile THEN the system SHALL open the document using the device's default browser or app
4. WHEN viewing matter cards on mobile THEN the system SHALL display the document indicator and allow quick access to recent documents
5. WHEN using touch gestures on mobile THEN the system SHALL support swipe actions for common document operations (view, edit, delete)
