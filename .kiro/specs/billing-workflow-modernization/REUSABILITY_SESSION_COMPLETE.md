## Reusable Patterns Established

### Pattern 1: Async Operations
```typescript
const { isLoading, execute } = useLoadingState({
  onSuccess: () => toastService.success('Success!'),
  onError: (err) => toastService.error(err.message),
});
await execute(() => api.operation());
```

### Pattern 2: Form Submissions
```typescript
const { isSubmitting, handleSubmit } = useFormSubmission({
  onSubmit: async (data) => await api.save(data),
  successMessage: 'Saved!',
  onSuccess: () => navigate('/success'),
});
```

### Pattern 3: Error Handling
```typescript
try {
  await operation();
} catch (error) {
  throw handleApiError(error);
}
```
