Error Rate = (Number of errors / Total tasks) × 100
```

**Target Benchmarks:**
- Success Rate: >80%
- Average Time: Within 120% of expert time
- Error Rate: <10%
- Overall Satisfaction: >7/10

---

### Step 3: Identify Patterns

**Look for:**
1. **Common Pain Points:**
   - Issues reported by 3+ participants
   - Tasks with >50% failure rate
   - Features causing confusion

2. **Positive Patterns:**
   - Features with high satisfaction
   - Workflows completed quickly
   - Positive feedback themes

3. **User Segments:**
   - Do senior vs. junior users struggle differently?
