## Best Practices Observed

The Phase 1 pages demonstrate excellent implementation patterns:

1. **Consistent Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks in all async operations
   - User-friendly error messages via toast
   - Retry functionality in error states

2. **Loading States**
   - Skeleton loaders during data fetch
   - Disabled buttons during async operations
   - Loading indicators on buttons

3. **User Feedback**
   - Toast notifications for all actions
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - Success/error feedback after operations

4. **Navigation Patterns**
   - Consistent use of React Router
   - Proper query parameter handling
   - Back navigation where appropriate

5. **Bulk Operations**
   - Selection state management with custom hook
   - Confirmation for destructive bulk actions
   - Progress feedback during bulk operations

6. **Accessibility**
   - Proper button labels
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - ARIA attributes where needed

## Code Quality Notes

### Excellent Patterns

- **EnhancedDashboardPage**: Model implementation with lazy loading, auto-refresh, and comprehensive error handling
- **MattersPage**: Excellent use of custom hooks (useSelection, useConfirmation)
- **InvoicesPage**: Clean tab system with proper component separation

### Minor Cleanup Needed

- **MattersPage**: Remove unused `setSearchTerm` variable
- **DashboardPage**: Consolidate duplicate "New Matter" button logic

## Recommendations for Next Phases

Based on Phase 1 findings, recommendations for auditing remaining pages:

1. **Look for similar patterns**: The TODO comments for email notifications in MattersPage suggest there may be similar incomplete features elsewhere

2. **Check for redundant UI**: The single-tab system in DashboardPage suggests we should look for other redundant UI elements

3. **Verify modal implementations**: DashboardPage references modals that don't exist - check if this pattern exists elsewhere

4. **Validate empty states**: All Phase 1 pages have good empty states - ensure this continues in other pages
