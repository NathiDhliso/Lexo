# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on conducting a comprehensive audit of all interactive UI elements (buttons, tabs, links, and other clickable components) across the entire application. The goal is to ensure every interactive element either has proper functionality implemented or is removed if it serves no purpose. This audit will improve user experience by eliminating confusion from non-functional UI elements and ensuring all interactive components behave as expected.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Interactive Element Discovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify all interactive UI elements in the application, so that I can systematically review each one.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting the audit THEN the system SHALL identify all buttons across all pages and components
2. WHEN conducting the audit THEN the system SHALL identify all tabs and tab panels across all pages
3. WHEN conducting the audit THEN the system SHALL identify all clickable links and navigation elements
4. WHEN conducting the audit THEN the system SHALL identify all form submit actions and interactive controls
5. WHEN conducting the audit THEN the system SHALL document the location (file path and component name) of each interactive element

### Requirement 2: Functionality Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that each interactive element has proper logic behind it, so that users don't encounter broken or non-functional UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing a button THEN the system SHALL verify it has an onClick handler or form submission logic
2. WHEN reviewing a tab THEN the system SHALL verify it has proper state management and content switching logic
3. WHEN reviewing a link THEN the system SHALL verify it has a valid navigation target or action
4. WHEN an interactive element lacks functionality THEN the system SHALL flag it for either implementation or removal
5. WHEN an interactive element has partial functionality THEN the system SHALL document what's missing

### Requirement 3: Dead Code Removal

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove non-functional UI elements that serve no purpose, so that the interface is clean and doesn't confuse users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an interactive element is identified as non-functional THEN the system SHALL determine if it should be removed or implemented
2. WHEN an element should be removed THEN the system SHALL remove it from the component
3. WHEN removing an element THEN the system SHALL ensure no broken references remain in the codebase
4. WHEN removing an element THEN the system SHALL update any related documentation or comments
5. IF an element is deprecated THEN the system SHALL check for and remove any deprecated component files

### Requirement 4: Missing Logic Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement missing logic for interactive elements that should be functional, so that the application behaves as users expect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an element should be functional but lacks logic THEN the system SHALL implement the appropriate handler
2. WHEN implementing logic THEN the system SHALL follow existing patterns in the codebase
3. WHEN implementing logic THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling
4. WHEN implementing logic THEN the system SHALL include loading states where appropriate
5. WHEN implementing logic THEN the system SHALL ensure the implementation is accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)

### Requirement 5: Tab System Audit

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all tab systems have proper content and functionality, so that users can navigate between different views effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing a tab system THEN the system SHALL verify each tab has corresponding content
2. WHEN reviewing a tab system THEN the system SHALL verify tab switching logic works correctly
3. WHEN reviewing a tab system THEN the system SHALL verify active tab state is properly managed
4. WHEN a tab has no content THEN the system SHALL either implement content or remove the tab
5. WHEN tab content is incomplete THEN the system SHALL document what needs to be added

### Requirement 6: Modal and Dialog Audit

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all modal triggers and dialog buttons work correctly, so that users can interact with overlays and forms properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing modal triggers THEN the system SHALL verify they properly open the intended modal
2. WHEN reviewing modal actions THEN the system SHALL verify submit and cancel buttons work correctly
3. WHEN reviewing modals THEN the system SHALL verify they have proper close functionality
4. WHEN reviewing modals THEN the system SHALL verify they handle form validation appropriately
5. WHEN a modal trigger is broken THEN the system SHALL either fix or remove it

### Requirement 7: Navigation Element Audit

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all navigation elements lead to valid destinations, so that users can move through the application without encountering dead ends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing navigation links THEN the system SHALL verify they point to valid routes
2. WHEN reviewing navigation buttons THEN the system SHALL verify they trigger proper navigation actions
3. WHEN reviewing breadcrumbs THEN the system SHALL verify they navigate to correct parent pages
4. WHEN a navigation element is broken THEN the system SHALL fix the routing or remove the element
5. WHEN navigation requires permissions THEN the system SHALL verify proper access control is implemented

### Requirement 8: Form Action Audit

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all form buttons and actions work correctly, so that users can submit data and interact with forms successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing form submit buttons THEN the system SHALL verify they trigger form submission
2. WHEN reviewing form reset buttons THEN the system SHALL verify they clear form state
3. WHEN reviewing form cancel buttons THEN the system SHALL verify they properly close or navigate away
4. WHEN reviewing form actions THEN the system SHALL verify validation is properly implemented
5. WHEN form actions fail THEN the system SHALL verify proper error messages are displayed

### Requirement 9: Audit Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation of the audit findings, so that I can track progress and understand what was changed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting the audit THEN the system SHALL create a detailed report of all findings
2. WHEN documenting findings THEN the system SHALL categorize elements as: functional, needs-implementation, or should-remove
3. WHEN documenting findings THEN the system SHALL include file paths and line numbers
4. WHEN documenting findings THEN the system SHALL prioritize issues by severity and user impact
5. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL document what was fixed or removed

### Requirement 10: Testing and Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all changes maintain application functionality, so that the audit doesn't introduce new bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL verify no TypeScript errors are introduced
2. WHEN removing elements THEN the system SHALL verify no broken imports or references remain
3. WHEN implementing logic THEN the system SHALL verify the implementation works as expected
4. WHEN completing the audit THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all changes made
5. WHEN completing the audit THEN the system SHALL identify any remaining issues that need attention
