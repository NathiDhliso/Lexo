## 🎨 Implementation Details

### Modal Modes

The PaymentModal supports 3 modes:

```typescript
type PaymentModalMode = 'record' | 'view' | 'credit-note';
```

#### 1. Record Mode
- Records new payments against invoices
- Real-time balance calculation
- Overpayment warnings
- Full payment detection
- Multiple payment methods

#### 2. View Mode
- Displays payment history table
- Shows running balances
- Export to CSV
- Delete payments
- Payment notes

#### 3. Credit Note Mode
- Issues credit notes
- Reduces invoice balance
- Categorized reasons
- Validation against balance due

### Hook API

```typescript
const paymentModal = usePaymentModal();

// Methods
paymentModal.recordPayment(invoice);
paymentModal.viewHistory(invoice);
paymentModal.issueCreditNote(invoice);
paymentModal.close();

// State
paymentModal.isOpen
paymentModal.mode
paymentModal.invoice
```

## 📊 Consolidation Results

### Before
- RecordPaymentModal (standalone)
- Payment viewing (embedded in InvoiceDetailsModal)
- Credit note form (embedded in InvoiceDetailsModal)
- PaymentHistoryTable (separate component)

### After
- **PaymentModal** (unified component)
  - 3 modes
  - 3 forms
  - 1 hook
  - Clean API

### Reduction
- **4 scattered implementations → 1 unified modal**
- **75% reduction in payment UI complexity**

## 🔄 Migration Path

### Old Code
```tsx
import { RecordPaymentModal } from './components/invoices/RecordPaymentModal';

<RecordPaymentModal
  isOpen={isOpen}
  invoice={invoice}
  onClose={handleClose}
  onSuccess={handleSuccess}
/>
```

### New Code (Direct)
```tsx
import { PaymentModal } from './components/modals/payment';

<PaymentModal
  mode="record"
  isOpen={isOpen}
  invoice={invoice}
  onClose={handleClose}
  onSuccess={handleSuccess}
/>
```

### New Code (Hook)
```tsx
import { usePaymentModal, PaymentModal } from './components/modals/payment';

const paymentModal = usePaymentModal();

// Open
paymentModal.recordPayment(invoice);

// Render
<PaymentModal
  mode={paymentModal.mode}
  isOpen={paymentModal.isOpen}
  invoice={paymentModal.invoice}
  onClose={paymentModal.close}
  onSuccess={handleSuccess}
/>
```
