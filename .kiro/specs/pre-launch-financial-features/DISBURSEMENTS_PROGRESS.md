# Disbursements System - Implementation Progress

## Status: Feature Complete ✅

All disbursements system tasks have been completed! The system is ready for database migration and testing.

### Completed Tasks

#### ✅ Task 2.2: DisbursementService Class
**File:** `src/services/api/disbursement.service.ts`

Implemented comprehensive service layer with:
- `createDisbursement()` - Create new disbursements with validation
- `getDisbursementsByMatter()` - Fetch all disbursements for a matter
- `getUnbilledDisbursements()` - Get unbilled disbursements using DB function
- `updateDisbursement()` - Update existing disbursements (only if unbilled)
- `deleteDisbursement()` - Soft delete disbursements (only if unbilled)
- `markAsBilled()` - Mark disbursements as billed during invoice generation
- `getDisbursementSummary()` - Get reporting summary
- `getDisbursements()` - Paginated disbursement listing

**Features:**
- Full validation (amount > 0, description required)
- Authorization checks (user must own the matter)
- Prevents modification of billed disbursements
- Audit trail for all operations
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Error handling throughout

---

#### ✅ Task 2.3: LogDisbursementModal Component
**File:** `src/components/disbursements/LogDisbursementModal.tsx`

Created user-friendly modal for logging new disbursements:
- Form fields: description, amount, date, VAT toggle, receipt link
- Real-time VAT calculation (15%) and total display
- VAT applicable toggle (defaults to Yes)
- Input validation with field-level error messages
- Receipt link input (optional) for cloud storage links
- Clean, responsive UI with proper spacing
- Auto-resets form when modal opens

---

#### ✅ Task 2.4: DisbursementsTable Component
**File:** `src/components/disbursements/DisbursementsTable.tsx`

Built comprehensive table component with:
- Display all disbursements with description, amount, VAT, total, date
- Filter tabs: All, Unbilled, Billed
- Status badges (Billed/Unbilled)
- Edit/Delete actions (only for unbilled items)
- Receipt link display with external link icon
- Bulk selection support for invoice generation
- Totals footer showing aggregated amounts
- Empty state with helpful messaging
- Locked state for billed disbursements

**Additional Component:** `src/components/disbursements/EditDisbursementModal.tsx`
- Similar to LogDisbursementModal but for editing
- Pre-populates with existing disbursement data
- Prevents editing of billed disbursements

---

#### ✅ Task 2.5: Integration with MatterWorkbenchPage
**File:** `src/components/matters/workbench/WorkbenchExpensesTab.tsx`

Updated the Expenses tab to use new disbursements system:
- Replaced old ExpenseList with DisbursementsTable
- Added "Log Disbursement" button
- Display unbilled disbursements total in highlighted card
- Integrated LogDisbursementModal and EditDisbursementModal
- Auto-refresh on disbursement changes
- Shows total unbilled value ready for invoicing

#### ✅ Task 2.6: Update Invoice Generation
**Files:** `src/services/api/invoices.service.ts`

Updated invoice generation to include disbursements:
- Fetches unbilled disbursements using `get_unbilled_disbursements()` DB function
- Calculates total disbursements (including VAT)
- Includes disbursements in invoice total
- Marks disbursements as billed using `mark_disbursements_as_billed()` DB function
- Updated fee narrative to list individual disbursements with VAT indication
- Properly handles disbursements that already include VAT in their total

---

#### ✅ Task 2.7: Update Invoice PDF Template
**Files:** 
- `src/components/invoices/InvoiceDetailsModal.tsx`
- `src/components/invoices/InvoiceList.tsx`

Updated PDF generation to display disbursements:
- Fetches disbursements from new disbursements table
- Combines old expenses and new disbursements for display
- Maps disbursements to expense format for PDF rendering
- Shows VAT indication in category field
- Displays disbursements in the existing "Disbursements & Expenses" section
- Properly shows subtotals and VAT breakdown

### Pending Tasks

#### ⏳ Task 2: Database Schema Migration
**Status:** Ready to run
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250127000002_disbursements_system.sql`

The migration file is complete and ready to be executed. It includes:
- Disbursements table with all required fields
- VAT calculation as generated columns (vat_amount, total_amount)
- Indexes for performance (matter_id, invoice_id, unbilled)
- RLS policies for security
- Database functions:
  - `calculate_matter_wip_with_disbursements()` - Includes disbursements in WIP
  - `get_unbilled_disbursements()` - Fetch unbilled disbursements
  - `mark_disbursements_as_billed()` - Atomic billing operation
- Trigger to auto-update matter WIP when disbursements change
- Disbursement summary view for reporting

**Action Required:** Run this migration against the database

---

#### 🔲 Task 2.8: Unit Tests (Optional)
**Status:** Not started (optional task)
**Requirements:**
- Test VAT calculation logic
- Test WIP value updates
- Test invoice generation with disbursements

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE disbursements (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  matter_id UUID NOT NULL,
  advocate_id UUID NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (amount > 0),
  date_incurred DATE NOT NULL,
  vat_applicable BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  vat_amount DECIMAL(10,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
    CASE WHEN vat_applicable THEN amount * 0.15 ELSE 0 END
  ) STORED,
  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
    amount + CASE WHEN vat_applicable THEN amount * 0.15 ELSE 0 END
  ) STORED,
  receipt_link TEXT,
  invoice_id UUID,
  is_billed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### VAT Calculation
- VAT rate: 15% (South African standard)
- Calculated automatically in database as generated column
- Can be toggled on/off per disbursement
- Real-time display in UI

### WIP Integration
- Unbilled disbursements automatically included in matter WIP value
- Trigger updates WIP whenever disbursements are added/modified/deleted
- Separate tracking from professional fees

### Security
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own disbursements
- Authorization checks in service layer
- Billed disbursements are locked from modification
- Soft delete for audit trail

## Next Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**
   - Execute `20250127000002_disbursements_system.sql`
   - Verify tables, functions, and triggers are created
   - Test WIP calculation updates

2. **Update Invoice Generation (Task 2.6)**
   - Modify invoice service to include disbursements
   - Test invoice generation with mixed fees and disbursements

3. **Update PDF Template (Task 2.7)**
   - Add disbursements section to invoice PDF
   - Show proper VAT breakdown

4. **Testing**
   - Test complete workflow: log → edit → invoice → bill
   - Verify WIP calculations
   - Test edge cases (no VAT, mixed VAT)
