### 💡 Integration Notes

**To Use the Payment System:**

```typescript
// In any component with an invoice
import { RecordPaymentModal } from './components/invoices/RecordPaymentModal';
import { PaymentHistoryTable } from './components/invoices/PaymentHistoryTable';

// Record a payment
<RecordPaymentModal
  isOpen={showModal}
  invoice={invoice}
  onClose={() => setShowModal(false)}
  onSuccess={() => {
    // Refresh invoice data
    loadInvoice();
  }}
/>

// Display payment history
<PaymentHistoryTable
  invoiceId={invoice.id}
  onPaymentChange={() => {
    // Refresh invoice data
    loadInvoice();
  }}
/>
```

**Database Migration:**
```bash
# Apply the migration
supabase db push

# Or in Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
# Run: supabase/migrations/20250127000001_partial_payments_system.sql
```
