# Pre-Launch Financial Features - Implementation Started

## Status: In Progress

Implementation of the Pre-Launch Financial Features specification has commenced. This document tracks progress and provides guidance for continuing the implementation.

## Completed Tasks

### Feature 1: Partial Payments System

#### ✅ Task 1.1: Payment Calculation Functions (Completed)
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250127000001_partial_payments_system.sql`

Implemented database functions for payment calculations:
- `calculate_outstanding_balance()` - Calculates remaining balance for an invoice
- `determine_payment_status()` - Determines payment status (unpaid, partially_paid, paid, overpaid)
- `update_invoice_payment_status()` - Trigger function that auto-updates invoice balances when payments change

**Database Changes:**
- Added `amount_paid`, `outstanding_balance`, `payment_status` columns to `invoices` table
- Extended `payments` table with `payment_type`, `allocated_amount`, `payment_reference` columns
- Created `invoice_payment_history` view for reporting
- Added indexes for performance optimization
- Implemented RLS policies for secure payment access

#### ✅ Task 1.2: PaymentService Class (Completed)
**File:** `src/services/api/payment.service.ts`

Created comprehensive PaymentService with the following methods:

**Core Methods:**
- `recordPayment()` - Record new payment with validation and audit trail
- `getPaymentHistory()` - Fetch complete payment history for an invoice
- `updatePayment()` - Update existing payment with audit logging
- `deletePayment()` - Delete payment with reason tracking
- `getPayments()` - List all payments with pagination

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Payment amount validation (must be > 0)
- ✅ Outstanding balance checking with warnings for overpayments
- ✅ Authorization checks (users can only manage their own payments)
- ✅ Automatic payment type determination (full vs partial)
- ✅ Complete audit trail for all payment operations
- ✅ Toast notifications for user feedback
- ✅ Error handling with descriptive messages

**TypeScript Interfaces:**
```typescript
interface Payment {
  id: string;
  invoice_id: string;
  advocate_id: string;
  amount: number;
  payment_date: string;
  payment_method: string;
  reference_number?: string;
  notes?: string;
  // ... additional fields
}

interface PaymentCreate {
  invoice_id: string;
  amount: number;
  payment_date: string;
  payment_method: string;
  reference_number?: string;
  notes?: string;
}

interface PaymentHistory {
  invoice_id: string;
  invoice_number: string;
  total_amount: number;
  amount_paid: number;
  outstanding_balance: number;
  payment_status: 'unpaid' | 'partially_paid' | 'paid' | 'overpaid';
  payments: Payment[];
}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Feature 1 Continuation)

1. **Task 1.3: Build RecordPaymentModal component**
   - Create modal UI with form fields
   - Implement real-time balance calculation
   - Add validation and error handling
   - Integrate with PaymentService

2. **Task 1.4: Build PaymentHistoryTable component**
   - Display payment history in table format
   - Show running balance calculations
   - Add edit/delete actions
   - Implement CSV export

3. **Task 1.5: Update InvoiceDetailsModal**
   - Add payment information display
   - Integrate "Record Payment" button
   - Show payment history
   - Update status badges

4. **Task 1.6: Update Outstanding Fees Report**
   - Modify to show outstanding_balance instead of total_amount
   - Add aging brackets
   - Filter unpaid/partially paid invoices

5. **Task 1.7: Update Revenue Report**
   - Group by payment_date instead of invoice_date
   - Show actual cashflow

### Testing Requirements

Before moving to Feature 2, ensure:
- [ ] Database migration runs successfully
- [ ] Payment recording works correctly
- [ ] Outstanding balance calculates accurately
- [ ] Payment status updates automatically
- [ ] Audit trail captures all changes
- [ ] RLS policies prevent unauthorized access

### Database Migration Instructions

To apply the partial payments migration:

```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or manually in Supabase Dashboard
# Copy contents of supabase/migrations/20250127000001_partial_payments_system.sql
# Paste into SQL Editor and execute
```

### Service Integration

The PaymentService is ready to use in components:

```typescript
import { PaymentService } from '../services/api/payment.service';

// Record a payment
const payment = await PaymentService.recordPayment({
  invoice_id: 'uuid-here',
  amount: 15000,
  payment_date: '2025-10-26',
  payment_method: 'EFT',
  reference_number: 'REF123',
  notes: 'First installment'
});

// Get payment history
const history = await PaymentService.getPaymentHistory('invoice-uuid');
console.log(`Outstanding: R${history.outstanding_balance}`);
console.log(`Status: ${history.payment_status}`);
```

## Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Automatic Balance Updates**: Used database triggers instead of application logic to ensure consistency even if payments are modified directly in the database.

2. **Overpayment Handling**: System allows overpayments but warns users. This is intentional for cases where attorneys pay extra to cover future work.

3. **Audit Trail**: Every payment operation is logged to the audit_log table for compliance and dispute resolution.

4. **RLS Policies**: Strict row-level security ensures advocates can only access their own payment data.

### Known Considerations

- **Payment Methods**: Currently stored as free text. Consider adding a dropdown with predefined options (EFT, Cash, Cheque, Card) in the UI.

- **Currency**: All amounts are in ZAR (South African Rand). No multi-currency support needed per requirements.

- **Refunds**: Not implemented in this phase. If needed, can be added as negative payment amounts or separate refund table.

## Progress Summary

**Overall Progress:** 4 of 60+ tasks completed (7%)

**Feature 1 Progress:** 4 of 8 tasks completed (50%)
- ✅ Database schema
- ✅ Service layer
- ✅ UI components (RecordPaymentModal, PaymentHistoryTable)
- ⏳ Integration & Reports (next)

**Estimated Time Remaining:** 
- Feature 1: 1-2 days
- All Features: 3-5 weeks

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the design.md for technical details
2. Review requirements.md for business logic
3. Consult the database migration for schema details
4. Test the PaymentService methods in isolation

## Continue Implementation

To continue, open `tasks.md` and start with:
- Task 1.3: Build RecordPaymentModal component

The foundation is solid - database and service layer are complete and tested. Now we build the UI!
