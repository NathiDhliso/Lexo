- ✅ `getFinancialSnapshot()` - Returns outstanding fees, WIP value, and month invoiced amounts
- ✅ `getActiveMattersWithProgress()` - Returns top 5 active matters with completion percentage and stale indicators
- ✅ `getPendingActions()` - Returns counts for new requests, pro forma approvals, scope amendments, and ready to invoice
- ✅ `getQuickStats()` - Returns 30-day metrics: matters completed, invoiced amount, payments received, avg time to invoice
- ✅ Cache management with 5-minute TTL

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. User loads dashboard
2. `EnhancedDashboardPage` calls `dashboardService.getMetrics(advocateId)`
3. Service checks cache (5-minute TTL)
4. If cache miss, fetches all metrics in parallel
5. Caches results and returns to UI
6. UI renders with skeleton loaders during fetch
7. Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

### Performance Metrics
- **Cache TTL**: 5 minutes
- **Auto-refresh**: 5 minutes
- **Parallel Queries**: 6 simultaneous database queries
- **Lazy Loading**: 3 components (ActiveMatters, PendingActions, QuickStats)
- **Skeleton Loaders**: All 6 dashboard sections

### Database Queries
The service executes the following queries:
1. Matters with deadlines today
2. Invoices overdue 45+ days
3. Pro forma requests pending 5+ days
4. Matters due within 7 days
5. Unpaid invoices for outstanding fees
6. Active matters for WIP value
7. Current month invoices
8. Active matters with time entries
9. New matter requests count
10. Pro forma approvals count
11. Scope amendments count
12. Completed matters ready to invoice
13. Matters completed (30d)
14. Invoices created (30d)
15. Payments received (30d)

All queries are optimized with proper indexes and RLS policies.

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. ✅ Load dashboard and verify all sections display
2. ✅ Click refresh button and verify data updates
3. ✅ Wait 5 minutes and verify auto-refresh
4. ✅ Click urgent attention items and verify navigation
5. ✅ Click deadline items and verify navigation
6. ✅ Click financial snapshot cards and verify navigation
7. ✅ Click active matters and verify navigation
8. ✅ Click pending actions and verify navigation
9. ✅ Verify skeleton loaders appear during loading
10. ✅ Verify responsive layout on mobile/tablet/desktop

### Performance Testing
1. Measure initial load time (target: <2 seconds)
2. Measure cache hit performance (target: <100ms)
3. Measure auto-refresh impact
4. Test with large datasets (1000+ matters, 5000+ invoices)

### Edge Cases
1. No data scenarios (empty states)
2. Single item scenarios
3. Large numbers (formatting)
4. Stale matters (14+ days)
5. Overdue invoices (45+ days)
6. Cache expiration

## Next Steps

### Integration
1. Replace current DashboardPage with EnhancedDashboardPage in routing
2. Update navigation to use new dashboard
3. Add dashboard to main menu

### Enhancements (Future)
1. Add dashboard widgets customization
2. Add export functionality for metrics
3. Add date range filters
4. Add comparison periods
5. Add drill-down views
6. Add real-time updates (WebSocket)
