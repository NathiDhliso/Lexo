- Numbering Audit Log
- Help text explaining SARS requirements

## SARS Compliance Features

### Sequential Numbering
✅ Invoice numbers are sequential with no gaps
✅ Automatic year rollover support
✅ Separate sequences for invoices and credit notes
✅ Voided numbers tracked with reasons

### VAT Requirements
✅ VAT registration status tracking
✅ VAT number prominently displayed
✅ Clear VAT breakdown on invoices
✅ Historical VAT rate tracking
✅ Automatic rate application by date

### Audit Trail
✅ Complete history of all numbers generated
✅ Voided numbers with reasons
✅ Export to CSV for tax records
✅ Filterable by date, type, and status

### Tax Invoice Format
✅ "TAX INVOICE" header when VAT registered
✅ All SARS-required fields included
✅ Advocate details (name, address, VAT number)
✅ Customer VAT number if available
✅ Clear amount breakdown

## Database Functions

### generate_next_invoice_number(advocate_id)
- Generates sequential invoice numbers
- Handles year rollover automatically
- Prevents race conditions with row locking
- Creates audit record
- Supports custom formats (YYYY, YY, NNN, NNNN)

### void_invoice_number(number, advocate_id, reason)
- Marks number as voided
- Requires reason for audit trail
- Prevents reuse of voided numbers

### get_vat_rate_for_date(advocate_id, date)
- Returns applicable VAT rate for invoice date
- Supports historical rate lookup
- Handles rate changes automatically

## Error Handling

### Invoice Generation Failures
- Numbers are automatically voided if invoice creation fails
- Reason is logged in audit trail
- No gaps in sequence
- User-friendly error messages

### Settings Validation
- VAT number required when VAT registered
- VAT rate must be between 0 and 100%
- Number format must contain sequence placeholder
- All validations with clear error messages

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Configure invoice settings in Settings > Invoicing
2. Generate test invoices and verify sequential numbering
3. Test year rollover by changing system date
4. Void an invoice and verify audit trail
5. Schedule future VAT rate change
6. Export audit log to CSV
7. Generate PDF and verify VAT compliance

### Database Testing
```sql
-- Test sequential numbering
SELECT generate_next_invoice_number('user-id');

-- Test voiding
SELECT void_invoice_number('INV-2025-001', 'user-id', 'Test void');

-- Test VAT rate lookup
SELECT get_vat_rate_for_date('user-id', '2025-01-27');

-- View audit trail
SELECT * FROM invoice_numbering_audit ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Migration Notes

### Running the Migration
```bash
# Apply the migration
supabase db push

# Or manually
psql -d your_database -f supabase/migrations/20250127000002_invoice_numbering_system.sql
```

### Initial Setup for Existing Users
Users will need to:
1. Navigate to Settings > Invoicing
2. Configure their invoice number format
3. Set VAT registration status
4. Enter advocate details for tax invoices

### Default Settings
- Invoice format: INV-YYYY-NNN
- Credit note format: CN-YYYY-NNN
- VAT rate: 15%
- VAT registered: false
- Sequences start at 0

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

- Custom format validation preview
- Integration with accounting systems
- Automated SARS eFiling export
- Multi-currency VAT handling
- Branch-specific numbering sequences

### Performance Optimizations
