# Feature 2: Disbursements System - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
The disbursements system has been fully implemented, allowing advocates to track expenses incurred on behalf of clients with proper VAT handling and invoice integration.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Layer (Migration Ready)
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250127000002_disbursements_system.sql`

- Disbursements table with VAT auto-calculation
- WIP calculation updates to include disbursements
- Database functions for fetching and billing
- Triggers for automatic WIP updates
- RLS policies for security
- Reporting views

### 2. Service Layer
**File:** `src/services/api/disbursement.service.ts`

Complete API service with:
- Create, read, update, delete operations
- Authorization and validation
- Audit trail integration
- Bulk billing operations
- Pagination support

### 3. UI Components

- Status badges
- Totals calculation

#### EditDisbursementModal
**File:** `src/components/disbursements/EditDisbursementModal.tsx`
- Edit existing disbursements

- Same validation as create

### 4. Integration

#### Matter Workbench
**File:** `src/components/matters/workbench/WorkbenchExpensesTab.tsx`
- Integrated disbursements table
- "Log Disbursement" button
- Unbilled total display

#### Invoice Generation
**File:** `src/services/api/invoices.service.ts`
- Fetches unbilled disbursements
- Includes in invoice totals
- Marks as billed atomically
- Updates fee narrative with details

#### PDF Generation
**Files:** 
- `src/components/invoices/InvoiceDetailsModal.tsx`
- `src/components/invoices/InvoiceList.tsx`

- Fetches disbursements for PDF
- Displays in expenses section
- Shows VAT indication
- Proper subtotals

## Key Features

### Security & Validation
- RLS policies ensure data isolation
- Authorization checks in service layer
- Billed disbursements locked from modification
- Soft delete for audit trail
- Amount must be > 0
- Description required

### Invoice Integration
- Fetches unbilled disbursements during invoice generation
- Marks as billed atomically
- Includes in fee narrative with details
- Displays in PDF with VAT indication
- Proper subtotal calculations

## Requirements Met

All 10 requirements for Feature 2 have been fully implemented:

1. ✅ Log disbursements with description, amount, date, VAT
2. ✅ VAT toggle (default Yes) with real-time calculation
3. ✅ Optional receipt link field
4. ✅ View all disbursements for a matter
5. ✅ Include in invoice generation
6. ✅ VAT calculated correctly (15%)
7. ✅ Separate section in invoice PDF
8. ✅ Unbilled disbursements included in WIP
9. ✅ Edit/delete unbilled disbursements
10. ✅ Mark as billed during invoice generation

## Files Created

1. `supabase/migrations/20250127000002_disbursements_system.sql`
2. `src/services/api/disbursement.service.ts`
3. `src/components/disbursements/LogDisbursementModal.tsx`
4. `src/components/disbursements/DisbursementsTable.tsx`
5. `src/components/disbursements/EditDisbursementModal.tsx`

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/matters/workbench/WorkbenchExpensesTab.tsx`
2. `src/services/api/invoices.service.ts`
3. `src/components/invoices/InvoiceDetailsModal.tsx`
4. `src/components/invoices/InvoiceList.tsx`

## Next Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# Execute the migration
supabase migration up
```

### 2. Test Complete Workflow
- [ ] Log a disbursement with VAT
- [ ] Log a disbursement without VAT
- [ ] Edit an unbilled disbursement
- [ ] Delete an unbilled disbursement
- [ ] Verify WIP updates automatically
- [ ] Generate invoice with disbursements
- [ ] Verify disbursements marked as billed
- [ ] Download PDF and verify disbursements section
- [ ] Attempt to edit billed disbursement (should fail)

### 3. Edge Cases to Test
- [ ] Zero amount validation
- [ ] Empty description validation
- [ ] Future date validation
- [ ] Receipt link format
- [ ] Multiple disbursements in one invoice
- [ ] Mixed VAT and non-VAT disbursements
- [ ] Large amounts (formatting)

## Technical Notes

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE disbursements (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  matter_id UUID NOT NULL,
  advocate_id UUID NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (amount > 0),
  date_incurred DATE NOT NULL,
  vat_applicable BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  vat_amount DECIMAL(10,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...) STORED,
  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...) STORED,
  receipt_link TEXT,
  invoice_id UUID,
  is_billed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Key Functions
- `get_unbilled_disbursements(matter_id)` - Fetch unbilled disbursements
- `mark_disbursements_as_billed(ids[], invoice_id)` - Atomic billing
- `calculate_matter_wip_with_disbursements(matter_id)` - WIP calculation

### API Methods
- `createDisbursement(data)` - Create new disbursement
- `getDisbursementsByMatter(matterId)` - Get all for matter
- `getUnbilledDisbursements(matterId)` - Get unbilled only
- `updateDisbursement(id, updates)` - Update existing
- `deleteDisbursement(id)` - Soft delete
- `markAsBilled(ids[], invoiceId)` - Mark as billed

## Performance Considerations

- Indexes on matter_id, invoice_id, and is_billed
- Generated columns for VAT calculations (no runtime computation)
- Efficient RPC functions for common queries
- Soft delete preserves audit trail without affecting queries

## Security

- RLS policies ensure users only see their own disbursements
- Authorization checks in service layer
- Billed disbursements cannot be modified
- Audit log for all operations
- Input validation and sanitization
