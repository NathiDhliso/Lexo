# Requirements Document: Calendar Integration

## Introduction

An advocate's life is ruled by deadlines - court dates, filing deadlines, client meetings, and matter milestones. Currently, advocates must manually transfer these dates from LexoHub to their personal calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar), creating friction and increasing the risk of missed deadlines.

The Calendar Integration feature solves this by providing a simple "Add to Calendar" button that generates universal .ics calendar files. This low-friction approach works with any calendar application without requiring complex OAuth integrations or two-way sync, making it easy to implement while solving the immediate pain point of double-entry for deadlines.

### Design Philosophy

- **Universal Compatibility**: Use .ics format that works with all calendar applications
- **One-Way Sync**: Simple "export to calendar" rather than complex two-way sync
- **Zero Configuration**: No OAuth setup or account linking required
- **Immediate Value**: Works instantly without setup or authentication

### Scope

**In Scope for MVP**:
- Generate .ics files for matter deadlines
- Generate .ics files for court dates
- Generate .ics files for client meetings
- "Add to Calendar" buttons throughout the application
- Customizable reminder settings
- Bulk export of upcoming deadlines

**Out of Scope for MVP**:
- Two-way calendar sync
- OAuth integration with Google Calendar/Outlook
- Automatic calendar updates when dates change
- Calendar conflict detection
- Shared team calendars
- Calendar view within LexoHub
