# Calendar Integration Feature Spec

## Overview

The Calendar Integration feature solves the double-entry pain point for advocates by providing one-click export of LexoHub events to any calendar application. Using the universal iCalendar (.ics) standard format, this feature works with Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar, and any other calendar application without requiring complex OAuth integrations.

## Problem Statement

An advocate's life is ruled by deadlines - court dates, filing deadlines, client meetings, and matter milestones. Currently, advocates must manually transfer these dates from LexoHub to their personal calendars, creating friction and increasing the risk of missed deadlines. This double-entry is time-consuming and error-prone.

## Solution

Simple "Add to Calendar" buttons throughout LexoHub that generate standards-compliant .ics files:
- One-click export for any event
- Works with all calendar applications
- No setup or authentication required
- Rich event descriptions with links back to LexoHub
- Customizable reminder settings
- Bulk export for upcoming deadlines

## Spec Documents

1. **[requirements.md](./requirements.md)** - Complete requirements with user stories and acceptance criteria
2. **[design.md](./design.md)** - Technical design including ICS generation service and components
3. **[tasks.md](./tasks.md)** - Detailed implementation plan with 16 major tasks broken into 45+ actionable sub-tasks
