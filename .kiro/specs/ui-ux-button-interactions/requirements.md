# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to systematically enhance the UI/UX of the LexoHub application by ensuring every visual element, particularly buttons, performs its intended routing or action. The enhancement will focus on creating an intuitive, consistent, and delightful user experience that genuinely reflects the application's core values as a legal practice management system. The implementation will ensure all interactive elements have clear purposes, proper feedback mechanisms, and adhere to the application's design system theme (Mpondo Gold and Judicial Blue color scheme with metallic gray accents).

## Requirements

3. WHEN a button lacks functionality THEN the system SHALL flag it as requiring implementation
4. WHEN the audit is complete THEN the system SHALL produce a structured report listing all buttons with their current state and intended behavior
