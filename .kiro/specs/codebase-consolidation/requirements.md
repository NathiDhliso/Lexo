# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the systematic consolidation and deduplication of the codebase to eliminate redundant code, merge duplicate functionality, and create a cleaner, more maintainable system. The analysis has identified critical duplications in database migrations, service layers, documentation, and feature implementations that are creating technical debt and potential production issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Migration Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consolidated database migrations so that I can avoid schema conflicts and ensure consistent database state across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing billing preferences migrations THEN the system SHALL have only one authoritative migration file
2. WHEN reviewing invoice numbering migrations THEN the system SHALL have a single comprehensive migration handling all invoice numbering functionality
3. WHEN deploying to any environment THEN there SHALL be no conflicting or duplicate migration files
4. IF duplicate migrations exist THEN the system SHALL preserve the latest working version and remove obsolete ones
5. WHEN migrations are consolidated THEN all existing data SHALL remain intact and functional

### Requirement 2: Service Layer Unification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unified service interfaces so that I can maintain consistent business logic without duplicate implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling expenses and disbursements THEN the system SHALL use a single unified service interface
2. WHEN VAT calculations are needed THEN the system SHALL use specialized VAT service while integrating with unified disbursement service
3. WHEN updating expense/disbursement logic THEN developers SHALL only need to modify one service implementation
4. IF service consolidation occurs THEN all existing API endpoints SHALL continue to function without breaking changes
5. WHEN services are merged THEN all existing functionality SHALL be preserved and accessible

### Requirement 3: Documentation Consolidation

**User Story:** As a team member, I want a single source of truth for project status so that I can quickly understand current implementation state without conflicting information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing project status THEN there SHALL be one comprehensive status document
2. WHEN multiple audit reports exist THEN they SHALL be merged into a unified report
3. WHEN phase implementation files overlap THEN they SHALL be consolidated into chronological progress tracking
4. IF documentation conflicts exist THEN the most recent and accurate information SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN documentation is consolidated THEN historical information SHALL be archived appropriately

### Requirement 4: Feature List Accuracy

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want an accurate feature count so that I can properly assess project scope and completion status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN counting features THEN duplicate entries SHALL be identified and removed
2. WHEN billing model features are listed THEN they SHALL appear in only one category
3. WHEN mobile features are counted THEN responsive versions SHALL not be double-counted with desktop versions
4. WHEN database features are tallied THEN they SHALL not be counted multiple times across different categories
5. WHEN feature consolidation is complete THEN the accurate count SHALL be approximately 285 unique features

### Requirement 5: Production Safety

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consolidation changes to be safe for production so that existing functionality remains unaffected during cleanup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidation changes are made THEN all existing user-facing functionality SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN database migrations are consolidated THEN existing data SHALL not be lost or corrupted
3. WHEN services are merged THEN API responses SHALL maintain backward compatibility
4. IF consolidation introduces issues THEN changes SHALL be easily reversible
5. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN system performance SHALL be maintained or improved

### Requirement 6: Code Quality Improvement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved code organization so that I can more easily maintain and extend the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are consolidated THEN code duplication SHALL be eliminated
2. WHEN similar functionality exists THEN it SHALL follow consistent patterns
3. WHEN unused code is identified THEN it SHALL be safely removed
4. IF consolidation opportunities exist THEN they SHALL be prioritized by impact and risk
5. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN code maintainability SHALL be measurably improved

### Requirement 7: Attorney Portal Accuracy

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want accurate reporting of attorney portal completeness so that I can properly assess feature delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing attorney portal status THEN documentation SHALL reflect actual implementation state
2. WHEN attorney portal pages exist THEN they SHALL be properly documented as functional
3. WHEN audit reports are updated THEN they SHALL correct previous inaccuracies about attorney portal completeness
4. IF attorney portal functionality is working THEN it SHALL not be marked as incomplete or stub implementation
5. WHEN attorney portal assessment is complete THEN all 6 pages SHALL be confirmed as functional
