# Pro Forma Pre-Population Fix - Quick Start

## What Was Fixed? 🎯

✅ Matter type now pre-populates in advocate's modal  
✅ Rate cards automatically filter by matter type  
✅ Case title and urgency save correctly  
✅ Complete data flow from attorney to advocate  

## Run This Now! ⚡

### Step 1: Run the Migration
```bash
supabase migration up
```

**OR** run this SQL in Supabase dashboard:
```sql
ALTER TABLE proforma_requests ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS matter_type TEXT;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_proforma_requests_matter_type ON proforma_requests(matter_type);
```

### Step 2: Test It
1. **As Attorney:** Submit a request with matter type selected
2. **As Advocate:** Click "Review & Quote" → "Create Pro Forma Quote"
3. **Verify:** Matter type is pre-selected and rate cards are filtered ✅

## What Changed?

### Files Modified
- ✅ `src/pages/ProFormaRequestPage.tsx` - Saves matter_type
- ✅ `src/components/proforma/ReviewProFormaRequestModal.tsx` - Passes matter_type
- ✅ `src/components/proforma/CreateProFormaModal.tsx` - Pre-populates matter_type
- ✅ Database migration added

### No Breaking Changes
- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing requests still work
- Optional fields degrade gracefully

## Before vs After

### Before ❌
```
Advocate opens modal:
- Matter Type: [empty dropdown]
- Rate Cards: [all 50+ cards shown]
- Advocate: "Ugh, I have to re-enter everything..."
```

### After ✅
```
Advocate opens modal:
- Matter Type: "Commercial Law" [pre-selected]
- Rate Cards: [only 8 relevant cards shown]
- Advocate: "Perfect! Everything is ready to go!"
```
