# Deployment Checklist - Document Processing Fix

## Pre-Deployment

- [x] Fix implemented in `aws-document-processing.service.ts`
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] Fallback method added
- [x] Error handling improved

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test the build locally**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. **Deploy to production**
   - Upload the `dist` folder to your hosting service
   - Or run your deployment command (e.g., `npm run deploy`)

4. **Verify environment variables**
   - Check that production has the correct AWS credentials
   - Or verify that the app works without them (fallback mode)

## Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Test document upload**
   - Try uploading a document in production
   - Verify no errors in browser console
   - Check that document processing completes

2. **Monitor logs**
   - Check for any "Bedrock processing failed" warnings
   - Verify "Using fallback document extraction" appears if AWS not configured

3. **User testing**
   - Have a user test the document upload feature
   - Confirm the feature works end-to-end

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert to previous deployment
2. Check AWS credentials in production environment
3. Review browser console errors
4. Contact support with error logs

## Success Criteria

- ✅ No "AWS Bedrock not configured" errors in production
- ✅ Document upload works with or without AWS
- ✅ Users can process documents successfully
- ✅ Graceful degradation when AWS unavailable
