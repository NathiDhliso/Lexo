# Firms Page - Quick Fix Summary

## The Problem
Clicking on any "Firms" menu item would not navigate to the Firms page. The page would briefly flash or users would remain on the current page.

## The Solution
**Fixed missing navigation case in `AppRouter.tsx`**

The `handlePageChange` function was missing the `'firms'` case, causing all firms navigation attempts to fall through to the default case and redirect to the dashboard.

## What Changed
Added this case to the switch statement in `AppRouter.tsx`:
```typescript
case 'firms':
  navigate('/firms');
  break;
```

## How to Test
1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Click on any firms-related menu item:
   - "Firms" in the top navigation
   - "All Firms" in the mega menu
   - "Attorneys" view
   - "Pending Invitations" view
   - "Invite Attorney" action
3. The Firms page should now load correctly

## Additional Notes
- The 406 cloud storage errors are unrelated to this navigation issue
- Those errors can be fixed separately using `FIX_FIRMS_RLS.sql` if needed
- Enhanced logging has been added to help debug any future issues

## Files Changed

- ✅ `src/pages/FirmsPage.tsx` - Added debug logging
- ✅ `FIX_FIRMS_RLS.sql` - Created for cloud storage fix (optional)
