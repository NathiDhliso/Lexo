# Button Routing Fix - Complete

**Date:** January 10, 2025  
**Issue:** Buttons routing back to dashboard instead of correct pages  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The DashboardPage had an incorrect page name in one of the Card onClick handlers:
- **Incorrect:** `onClick={() => onNavigate?.('proforma')}`
- **Correct:** `onClick={() => onNavigate?.('proforma-requests')}`

The valid page names are defined in `src/types/index.ts`:
```typescript
export type Page =
  | 'dashboard'
  | 'proforma-requests'  // ← Correct name
  | 'matters'
  | 'matter-workbench'
  | 'invoices'
  | 'profile'
  | 'settings'
  | 'reports'
  | 'analytics'
  | 'partner-approval'
```

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

**File:** `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`

**Line 390 - Changed:**
```tsx
// Before (WRONG):
<Card hoverable onClick={() => onNavigate?.('proforma')} ...>

// After (CORRECT):
<Card hoverable onClick={() => onNavigate?.('proforma-requests')} ...>
```
