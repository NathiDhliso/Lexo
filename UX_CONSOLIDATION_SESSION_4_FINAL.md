**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  

---

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Successfully consolidated all payment-related UI into a single, unified **PaymentModal** component.

### Before → After
```
❌ RecordPaymentModal (standalone)
❌ Payment viewing (embedded in InvoiceDetailsModal)
❌ Credit note form (embedded in InvoiceDetailsModal)
❌ PaymentHistoryTable (separate component)

✅ PaymentModal (unified)
   ├── record mode
   ├── view mode
   └── credit-note mode
```

**Result:** 75% reduction in payment UI complexity
