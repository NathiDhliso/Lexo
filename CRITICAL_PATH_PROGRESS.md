- ‚úÖ Task 1.4: Delete obsolete attorney portal
- ‚úÖ Task 1.6: Fix remaining imports
- ‚úÖ Task 6.3: Implement Time tab

### Remaining: 8/11 Critical Path Tasks (73%)
- ‚è≥ Task 8.1: Migrate attorneys to firms
- ‚è≥ Task 8.2: Populate firm_id on matters
- ‚è≥ Task 8.3: Make firm_id NOT NULL (needs correction)
- ‚è≥ Task 8.4: Validate firm_id in matter creation

- ‚è≥ Task 9.6: Verify obsolete code removed

### Estimated Time to Complete: 4-5 hours

---

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Execute data migration tasks (8.1, 8.2, 8.3) - This is blocking for production
2. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Add server-side validation (8.4, 8.5, 8.6) - Critical for data integrity
3. **FINAL POLISH:** Complete Phase 9 tasks - Required for deployment

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues Resolved

### Issue: Task 8.3 Marked Complete Prematurely
- **Problem:** Task 8.3 (Make firm_id NOT NULL) was checked as complete, but tasks 8.1 and 8.2 (data migration) were not done
- **Resolution:** Verified that the migration hasn't actually been executed - database is still safe with nullable firm_id
- **Action:** Will execute tasks in correct order: 8.1 ‚Üí 8.2 ‚Üí 8.3

### Issue: Broken Imports from Deleted Files
- **Problem:** Multiple files importing deleted components causing compilation errors
- **Resolution:** Systematically removed all broken imports and commented out deleted modal usages
- **Result:** Application now compiles without errors

---

## üìù Notes

- Document processing feature has been fully removed from the codebase
- Obsolete Pro Forma creation modals (CreateProFormaModal, NewProFormaModal) have been deleted
- SimpleProFormaModal exists as the replacement but integration is not part of critical path
- All core WIP tracking UI components are in place and functional
