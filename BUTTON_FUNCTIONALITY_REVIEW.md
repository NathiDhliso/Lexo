# Button Functionality Review

## Summary

I've reviewed all the buttons you identified. Good news - most are already properly implemented!

## ✅ Already Working Properly

### 1. SubscriptionCallbackPage.tsx
**Status:** Fully functional

The "Go to Dashboard" button is already properly implemented:
```typescript
<Button onClick={() => navigate('/dashboard')} className="w-full">
  Go to Dashboard
</Button>
```

The page also has automatic redirect logic that navigates to dashboard after 3 seconds on success.

### 2. CloudStorageCallbackPage.tsx
**Status:** Fully functional

The page automatically handles navigation:
- On success: Redirects to the original redirect URL or `/settings`
- On error: Redirects to `/settings` after 3 seconds

No manual button implementation needed - it's all automatic.

### 3. TeamManagement.tsx
**Status:** Fully functional

Both buttons are properly implemented:
- **Remove button:** Calls `handleRemoveMember(member.id)` which deletes from database
- **Resend Invite button:** Calls `handleResendInvite(member)` to resend invitation

These are working production features, not placeholders.

## ⚠️ Design Pattern (Not a Bug)

### 4. BulkActionToolbar.tsx
**Status:** Working as designed

This is a **reusable component** that accepts custom actions via props. The default actions with console warnings are intentional examples to show developers how to use it.

**How it's meant to be used:**
```typescript
<BulkActionToolbar
  selectedCount={selectedIds.size}
  totalCount={items.length}
  actions={[
    {
      id: 'delete',
      label: 'Delete',
      icon: <Trash2 />,
      variant: 'danger',
      onClick: handleBulkDelete, // Your custom function
      requiresConfirmation: true,
    },
  ]}
  onClearSelection={clearSelection}
/>
```

**What I changed:** Updated the console.log to console.warn with clearer messaging that these are examples and custom actions should be passed via props.

### 5. Button.examples.tsx & ConfirmationDialog.examples.tsx
**Status:** Working as designed

These are **example/documentation files** (note the `.examples.tsx` suffix). They're meant to show developers how to use the components, so console.log statements are expected and appropriate.

## Recommendation

No action needed! All user-facing buttons are properly implemented. The only "placeholders" are in:
1. Reusable components designed to accept custom actions
2. Example/documentation files

If you want to use BulkActionToolbar in a specific page (like MattersPage or InvoicesPage), I can help you implement that with proper delete/export functionality.
