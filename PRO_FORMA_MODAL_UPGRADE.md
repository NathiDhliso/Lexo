- **Professional PDF Export**: Generate branded PDFs using your custom templates
- **Two-Step Workflow**: Input → Review → Download

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. AI Integration

    matterId: matterId || 'temp-' + Date.now(),
    includeValuePropositions: true,
  });
  
  toast.success('AI analysis complete!');

    work_title: formData.matterName,
    client: { name: formData.clientName },
    estimated_amount: estimate.subtotal,
    metadata: { services: selectedServices },
  };

  await proFormaPDFService.downloadProFormaPDF(proformaData, advocateInfo);
};
```

  };

  return (
    <CreateProFormaModal
      isOpen={isOpen}
