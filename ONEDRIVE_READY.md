# ✅ OneDrive Integration Ready!

Your OneDrive cloud storage integration is now configured and ready to use.

## What I've Done

### 1. Updated Configuration Files
- ✅ Added `authority` field to OneDrive OAuth config
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript types for OAuth configuration
- ✅ Updated `.env` template with `VITE_ONEDRIVE_AUTHORITY`
- ✅ Configured proper scopes: `Files.ReadWrite`, `Files.ReadWrite.All`, `User.Read`, `offline_access`

### 2. Created Documentation
- ✅ `ONEDRIVE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete step-by-step setup guide
- ✅ `ONEDRIVE_QUICK_START.md` - 5-minute quick start guide
- ✅ `test-onedrive-config.ts` - Configuration verification script

## Next Steps for You

### Step 1: Get Azure Credentials (5 minutes)

Follow the quick start guide:
```bash
# Open the guide
cat ONEDRIVE_QUICK_START.md
```

Or go directly to: https://portal.azure.com

### Step 2: Update .env File

Add your credentials to `.env`:
```env
VITE_ONEDRIVE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-from-azure
VITE_ONEDRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-from-azure
VITE_ONEDRIVE_AUTHORITY=https://login.microsoftonline.com/common
```

### Step 3: Test Configuration (Optional)

```bash
npx tsx test-onedrive-config.ts
```

### Step 4: Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Test in Browser

1. Go to: http://localhost:5173
2. Navigate to: Settings → Cloud Storage
3. Click "Connect" on OneDrive card
4. Sign in with your Microsoft account
5. Grant permissions
6. Done! ✅

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User clicks "Connect OneDrive"
2. Redirected to Microsoft login page
3. User signs in with **their own** Microsoft account
4. User grants permission for your app to access their OneDrive
5. OAuth tokens stored securely in database
6. User's documents can now sync to **their personal** OneDrive

### Security:
- ✅ Each user connects their own OneDrive account
- ✅ OAuth 2.0 authentication (industry standard)
- ✅ Tokens stored encrypted in database
- ✅ You never see user passwords
- ✅ Users can disconnect anytime
- ✅ Tokens can be revoked by user at any time

## Database Tables

Make sure you've run the database migration:
```bash
# Run the fix script in Supabase SQL Editor
# File: fix-cloud-storage-now.sql
```

This creates:
- `cloud_storage_connections` - Stores user OAuth connections
- `cloud_storage_sync_log` - Tracks sync operations
- `document_cloud_storage` - Maps documents to cloud files

## Troubleshooting

### "onedrive is not configured"
→ Environment variables not loaded. Restart dev server.

### "redirect_uri_mismatch"
→ Check Azure redirect URI matches exactly: `http://localhost:5173/settings/cloud-storage/callback`

### "invalid_client"
→ Double-check Client ID and Secret in `.env`

### Still having issues?
→ See `ONEDRIVE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Create separate Azure App Registration for production
2. Add production redirect URI: `https://your-domain.com/settings/cloud-storage/callback`
3. Add credentials to your hosting platform's environment variables
4. Never commit secrets to Git!

## What's Next?

After OneDrive is working, you can add other providers:
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- Box

Each follows a similar OAuth flow. Let me know when you're ready!

## Files Created
