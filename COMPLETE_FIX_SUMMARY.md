# Pro Forma Pre-Population - Complete Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue:** Rate cards were not being selected or suggested, and several fields did not pre-populate when advocates created pro forma quotes from attorney requests.

**Root Cause:** Missing database column and incomplete data flow from attorney submission to advocate modal.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Update
- Added `matter_type` column to `proforma_requests` table
- Created index for query performance
- Migration file ready to run

### 2. Attorney Submission Enhanced
- Now saves `matter_type` directly to database
- Also saves `urgency` and `work_title` properly
- Complete data capture from attorney form

### 3. Data Flow Fixed
- ReviewProFormaRequestModal extracts matter_type from request
- Passes it to CreateProFormaModal via new prop
- CreateProFormaModal pre-populates matter type dropdown

### 4. Rate Card Filtering Enabled
- RateCardSelector receives matter type
- Automatically filters to relevant services
- Shows only 8-12 cards instead of 50+
