# Pro Forma Pre-Population Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Matter Type Not Pre-Populating
**Problem:** When advocates reviewed attorney requests, the matter type field was empty in the CreateProFormaModal.

**Solution:**
- Added `matter_type` column to `proforma_requests` table
- Updated ProFormaRequestPage to save matter_type directly (not in metadata)
- Added `initialMatterType` prop to CreateProFormaModal
- Updated ReviewProFormaRequestModal to pass matter_type to CreateProFormaModal

### 2. Rate Cards Not Being Suggested
**Problem:** Rate cards weren't automatically filtered by matter type when the modal opened.

**Solution:**
- RateCardSelector already supports `matterType` prop filtering
- Now that matter type is pre-populated, rate cards will automatically filter
- Rate cards matching the matter type will be displayed immediately

### 3. Other Fields Not Pre-Populating
**Problem:** Case title and urgency weren't being saved from attorney submissions.

**Solution:**
- Updated ProFormaRequestPage submission to include:
  - `work_title` (case title)
  - `urgency` (urgency level)
  - `matter_type` (matter type)

## Files Modified

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250112000000_add_matter_type_to_proforma_requests.sql`
- Added `matter_type` column to proforma_requests table
- Created index for better query performance

### 2. CreateProFormaModal Component
**File:** `src/components/proforma/CreateProFormaModal.tsx`
- Added `initialMatterType?: string` prop
- Updated useEffect to set matterType from prop
- Matter type now pre-populates when modal opens

### 3. ReviewProFormaRequestModal Component
**File:** `src/components/proforma/ReviewProFormaRequestModal.tsx`
- Updated initialData state to include matterType
- Passes matter_type from request to CreateProFormaModal
- Extracts matter_type from request object

### 4. ProFormaRequestPage (Attorney Side)
**File:** `src/pages/ProFormaRequestPage.tsx`
- Updated submission to include matter_type, urgency, and work_title
- These fields now save directly to database columns
- Pre-fills form from existing data if available

## Data Flow

### Attorney Submits Request:
1. Attorney fills form with:
   - Case title → `work_title`
   - Matter type → `matter_type`
   - Urgency → `urgency`
   - Description → `work_description`
   - Contact details → `instructing_attorney_*`

2. Data saved to `proforma_requests` table

### Advocate Reviews Request:
1. Advocate clicks "Review & Quote" button
2. ReviewProFormaRequestModal opens with request data
3. Advocate clicks "Create Pro Forma Quote"
4. CreateProFormaModal opens with pre-populated data:
   - Matter name ← `work_title`
   - Client name ← `instructing_attorney_name`
   - Matter summary ← `work_description`
   - Matter type ← `matter_type` ✅ NEW

5. RateCardSelector automatically filters by matter type
6. Relevant rate cards are displayed immediately
