üîó Unified Invoice System

Matter-Centric Data Flow:
Pro Forma ‚Üí Matter (source_proforma_id)
    ‚Üì
Time Entries ‚Üí Matter (matter_id)
    ‚Üì
Expenses ‚Üí Matter (matter_id)
    ‚Üì

Key Features:
‚úÖ Select matter ‚Üí Everything auto-loads
‚úÖ Pro forma services auto-imported (if linked)
‚úÖ Time entries auto-imported (unbilled only)
‚úÖ Expenses auto-imported
‚úÖ All items pre-selected for review
‚úÖ Single source of truth (the matter)
```

**New Invoice Page Documentation:**
- 4 tabs: Invoices, Pro Forma, Time Entries, Payment Tracking
- Key components: MatterSelectionModal, UnifiedInvoiceWizard, ProFormaInvoiceList, MatterTimeEntriesView

## What Changed

### Before
- Invoice generation was manual
- No automatic data import
- Pro forma and time entries were separate
- No clear linkage between components

### After
- **Matter-centric approach**: Everything links through matter ID
- **Automatic data import**: Pro forma services, time entries, and expenses auto-load
- **Unified interface**: 4-tab invoice page with complete billing overview
- **Clear workflow**: Select matter ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Configure ‚Üí Generate

## Key Concepts Now Documented

### 1. Matter-Centric Data Flow
All billing data flows through the matter ID, creating a single source of truth.

### 2. Auto-Import System
When generating an invoice:
- System automatically loads pro forma services (if matter linked)
- System automatically loads unbilled time entries
- System automatically loads expenses
- All items pre-selected for user review

### 3. Unified Invoice Page
4 tabs provide complete billing visibility:
- **Invoices**: Generate and manage final invoices
- **Pro Forma**: View and convert pro forma requests
- **Time Entries**: See unbilled work grouped by matter
- **Payment Tracking**: Monitor payments and overdue invoices

### 4. Component Architecture
New components support the unified flow:
- `MatterSelectionModal`: Smart matter picker with billing data
- `UnifiedInvoiceWizard`: Auto-importing invoice generator
- `ProFormaInvoiceList`: Pro forma management
- `MatterTimeEntriesView`: Time entry overview by matter

## Documentation Consistency

All three documentation files now consistently describe:
- ‚úÖ The matter-centric data flow
- ‚úÖ The auto-import functionality
- ‚úÖ The 4-tab invoice page structure
- ‚úÖ The linkage through matter ID
- ‚úÖ The unified invoice workflow

## For Developers

When working with the invoice system, refer to:
- **SYSTEM_PROMPT.md** - Complete technical details and file structure
- **START_HERE.md** - Quick reference and workflow overview
- **README.md** - Setup and feature documentation
- **UNIFIED_INVOICE_FLOW.md** - Detailed implementation guide
- **INVOICE_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md** - Complete feature summary

## Summary

The documentation has been updated to accurately reflect the new unified, matter-centric invoice system where:
1. Everything links through matter ID
2. Pro forma services auto-import to invoices
3. Time entries auto-import to invoices
4. Expenses auto-import to invoices
5. The invoice page provides a complete billing hub with 4 tabs

All documentation is now consistent and up-to-date with the implemented system.
