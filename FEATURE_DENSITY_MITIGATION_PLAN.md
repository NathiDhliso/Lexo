# Feature Density Mitigation Plan

## Problem Statement
LexoHub has 200+ features which can feel overwhelming for new users, particularly during initial onboarding.

## Solution Strategy

### 1. **Progressive Disclosure Architecture**
Instead of exposing all features at once, we'll introduce features gradually based on:
- User role and subscription tier
- Onboarding completion stage
- Feature usage patterns
- User expertise level

### 2. **Contextual Help System**
Provide help exactly when and where users need it through:
- Inline tooltips with keyboard shortcut `?`
- Feature spotlights for new capabilities
- Step-by-step walkthroughs
- Video tutorials embedded in context
- Searchable help center

### 3. **Intelligent Onboarding**
Multi-phase onboarding that adapts to user needs:
- **Phase 1**: Essential Setup (5 mins)
- **Phase 2**: Core Workflow (15 mins)
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Features (Optional)
- **Phase 4**: Power User Features (On-demand)

```

### 2. Add Help Context Provider
```tsx
// Wrap app with HelpProvider
<HelpProvider>
  <App />
</HelpProvider>
```

### 3. Use Contextual Help in Components
```tsx
import { useHelp } from '@/hooks/useHelp';

function MyComponent() {
  const { showTooltip, startTour } = useHelp();
  
  return (
    <Button 
      onMouseEnter={() => showTooltip('create-matter')}
      onClick={() => startTour('matter-creation')}
    >
      Create Matter
    </Button>
  );
}
```

### 4. Define Feature Tours
```tsx
// tours/matter-creation.tour.ts
export const matterCreationTour = {
  id: 'matter-creation',
  steps: [
    { target: '.new-matter-btn', content: 'Click here to start' },
    { target: '.matter-form', content: 'Fill in the details' },
