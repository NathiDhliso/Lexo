## UI Structure (After Changes)

### Firm Card Layout
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🏢 Firm Name              ⋮ (Menu)      │
│ 👥 X Attorneys  💼 X Matters  📅 Est.   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│ Attorney Roster                         │
│ 👤 👤 👤 +2                             │
│                                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Add Attorney] [Manage Firm] [View...]  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Dropdown Menu (⋮)
- Manage Firm
- View Matters

### Page Header
```

```

## User Flow

1. **View Firms**: User sees all firm cards with attorney counts
2. **Add Attorney**: Click "Add Attorney" button on any firm card
3. **Fill Form**: Modal opens with form (firm name, attorney name, email, etc.)
4. **Submit**: Attorney/firm is added immediately to the database
5. **Refresh**: Firms list automatically refreshes to show the new entry

## Benefits

✅ **Cleaner UI** - Removed redundant "Add Attorney" button from page header
✅ **Contextual Action** - "Add Attorney" is now directly on the firm card where it makes sense
✅ **Simplified Menu** - Three-dot menu is shorter and more focused
✅ **No Database Migration** - Works with existing schema (no invitation token columns needed)
✅ **Immediate Availability** - No invitation workflow, attorneys are added instantly
✅ **Consistent Pattern** - Follows the same pattern as other card actions

## Modal Behavior

### AddAttorneyModal
- Opens when "Add Attorney" button clicked on any firm card
- Can be opened from any firm card (not tied to a specific firm anymore)
- Creates a new firm entry with attorney details
- Automatically associates with current user's advocate_id
- Refreshes firm list on success
