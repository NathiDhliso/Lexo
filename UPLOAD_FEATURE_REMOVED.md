---

## 📝 What You Asked For

> "Please check if my app has this feature if so please remove it i do not want any uploads in the system: 
> Supporting Documents (Optional) - Contracts, correspondence, court papers"

**Answer:** YES, your app had document upload functionality. It has now been COMPLETELY REMOVED.

---

## 🔍 What Was Found and Removed

### 1. **Upload Components** ❌ DELETED
- `DocumentUploadWithProcessing.tsx` - Handled file drag-and-drop uploads
- Upload step in `NewMatterMultiStep.tsx` - "Upload Attorney's Brief" form step
- Upload UI in `DocumentsTab.tsx` - File upload buttons and handlers

### 2. **Database Tables** ❌ WILL BE DROPPED
Migration created: `20250127000000_remove_document_upload_tables.sql`
- `document_uploads` - Stored file metadata and URLs
- `document_extracted_data` - AI-extracted data from documents  
- `document_cloud_storage` - Cloud sync for uploaded files

### 3. **AWS Configuration** ❌ DELETED
- `verify-aws-setup.ps1` - AWS S3 setup verification
- `s3-cors-config.json` - S3 CORS configuration

### 4. **Storage Operations** ❌ REMOVED
- Supabase storage bucket operations
- File upload to `documents` bucket
- Download/delete file operations

---

## ✅ What Was KEPT (Privacy-First Alternative)

Your app still has a **document reference system** that:
- ✅ Links to files in user's OWN cloud storage
- ✅ Stores only metadata (filename, location)
- ✅ Does NOT store actual file contents
- ✅ Respects attorney-client privilege

**Location:** `src/components/documents/DocumentsTab.tsx`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migration
```bash
# Review the migration first
cat supabase/migrations/20250127000000_remove_document_upload_tables.sql

# Apply it
supabase db push
```

### 2. Delete Storage Bucket (Manual)
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
- Delete the `documents` bucket
- This removes any previously uploaded files

### 3. Test Your App
- [ ] Create new matter (no upload step)
- [ ] View Documents tab (shows deprecation notice)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] App builds successfully
