## üîß Integration Steps

### Step 1: Add Imports to MatterWorkbenchPage
```typescript
// File: src/pages/MatterWorkbenchPage.tsx

import { RequestScopeAmendmentModal } from '../components/matters/RequestScopeAmendmentModal';
import { SimpleFeeEntryModal } from '../components/matters/SimpleFeeEntryModal';
import { AlertCircle, DollarSign } from 'lucide-react';
```

### Step 2: Add State Variables
```typescript
const [showScopeAmendmentModal, setShowScopeAmendmentModal] = useState(false);
const [showSimpleFeeModal, setShowSimpleFeeModal] = useState(false);
```

### Step 3: Add Buttons to UI
```typescript
{/* For Path A matters (from pro forma) */}
{selectedMatter?.status === 'active' && (selectedMatter as any).source_proforma_id && (
  <Button
    variant="outline"
    onClick={() => setShowScopeAmendmentModal(true)}
    className="border-judicial-blue-500 text-judicial-blue-700"
  >
    <AlertCircle className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
    Request Scope Amendment
  </Button>
)}

{/* For Path B matters (accepted brief) */}
{selectedMatter?.status === 'active' && !(selectedMatter as any).source_proforma_id && (
  <Button
    variant="outline"
    onClick={() => setShowSimpleFeeModal(true)}
    className="border-mpondo-gold-500 text-mpondo-gold-700"
  >
    <DollarSign className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
    Simple Fee Entry
  </Button>
)}
```

### Step 4: Add Modal Components
```typescript
<RequestScopeAmendmentModal
  isOpen={showScopeAmendmentModal}
  matter={selectedMatter}
  onClose={() => setShowScopeAmendmentModal(false)}
  onSuccess={fetchMatters}
/>

<SimpleFeeEntryModal
  isOpen={showSimpleFeeModal}
  matter={selectedMatter}
  onClose={() => setShowSimpleFeeModal(false)}
  onSuccess={fetchMatters}
/>
```
