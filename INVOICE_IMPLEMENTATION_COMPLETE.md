# Invoice System Implementation - Complete

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The invoice system has been completely redesigned with a **unified, matter-centric approach** that properly links pro forma requests, time entries, and invoices through the matter ID.

## What Was Built

### Core Components

1. **MatterSelectionModal** - Smart matter selection
   - Shows only matters with billable data
   - Displays pro forma amounts, unbilled hours, and time entry counts
   - Visual indicators for pro forma linkage
   - Search functionality

2. **UnifiedInvoiceWizard** - Auto-importing invoice generator
   - Automatically loads time entries from matter
   - Automatically loads pro forma services if matter is linked
   - Automatically loads expenses from matter
   - 3-step wizard: Review → Configure → Generate
   - All items pre-selected for user review

3. **ProFormaInvoiceList** - Pro forma management
   - View all pro forma requests
   - Track status and amounts
   - Convert accepted pro forma to matters
   - Filter by status

4. **MatterTimeEntriesView** - Time entry overview
   - View all time entries grouped by matter
   - See unbilled vs billed status
   - Generate invoices directly from matter groups
   - Search and filter capabilities

5. **Enhanced InvoicesPage** - Unified interface
   - 4 tabs: Invoices, Pro Forma, Time Entries, Payment Tracking
   - All billing data in one place
   - Consistent navigation

## How It Works

### The Unified Flow

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Pro Forma      │
│  Request        │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│  Matter         │◄─────┤  Time Entries   │
│  (source_       │      │  (matter_id)    │
│  proforma_id)   │      └─────────────────┘
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Invoice        │
│  Generation     │
│  (auto-imports) │
└─────────────────┘
```

### Key Principle

**Everything is linked by Matter ID:**
- Pro forma → Matter (via `source_proforma_id`)
- Time entries → Matter (via `matter_id`)
- Expenses → Matter (via `matter_id`)
- Invoice → Matter (via `matter_id`)

## User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Generate Invoice from Invoices Page

1. Click "Generate Invoice" button
2. **MatterSelectionModal** opens showing matters with:
   - Pro forma amounts (if linked)
   - Unbilled time hours and amounts
   - Number of time entries
3. Select a matter
4. **UnifiedInvoiceWizard** opens with:
   - ✅ Pro forma services (auto-loaded if linked)
   - ✅ Time entries (auto-loaded, pre-selected)
   - ✅ Expenses (auto-loaded if any)
5. Review items (all pre-selected)
6. Configure pricing, discounts, narrative
7. Review summary
8. Generate invoice

### Workflow 2: Pro Forma to Invoice

1. Navigate to **Pro Forma** tab
2. Create pro forma request
3. Send to attorney
4. Attorney accepts
5. Click "Convert to Matter"
6. Matter created with `source_proforma_id` set
7. Add time entries to matter
8. Generate invoice:
   - Pro forma services ✅ auto-loaded
   - Time entries ✅ auto-loaded
   - Combined in one invoice

### Workflow 3: Time Entries to Invoice

1. Navigate to **Time Entries** tab
2. See all time entries grouped by matter
3. Click "Generate Invoice" on a matter
4. Wizard opens with matter context
5. Time entries ✅ auto-loaded
6. Generate invoice

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

```typescript
// 1. User selects matter
MatterSelectionModal
  → loads all matters
  → fetches time entries per matter
  → fetches pro forma data if linked
  → shows matters with billing data

// 2. User selects a matter
onMatterSelected(matterWithBillingData)

// 3. Wizard auto-loads data
UnifiedInvoiceWizard
  → receives matter ID
  → loads unbilled time entries
  → loads pro forma services (if source_proforma_id exists)
  → pre-selects all items
  → user reviews and generates
```

### Database Relationships

```sql
proforma_requests.id ←─┐
                       │
matters.source_proforma_id
matters.id ←─┬─ time_entries.matter_id
             ├─ expenses.matter_id
             └─ invoices.matter_id
```
