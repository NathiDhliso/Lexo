# Build Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Attorney Page Exports (src/pages/index.ts)
**Problem:** The index.ts file was trying to export many attorney pages that don't exist.

**Solution:** Removed all non-existent attorney page exports and kept only:
- `AttorneyRegisterPage` (named export)
- `SubmitMatterRequestPage` (named export)

### 2. Document Processing Component (src/components/document-processing/)
**Problem:** `DocumentsTab.tsx` was importing `DocumentUploadWithProcessing` from a folder that should be deleted per the v8 Atomic Pipeline Overhaul Plan.

**Solution:** 
- Deleted the `DocumentUploadWithProcessing` component
- Updated `DocumentsTab.tsx` to remove the import and replace the upload UI with a placeholder message directing users to use cloud storage linking

### 3. AppRouter Attorney Page References (src/AppRouter.tsx)
**Problem:** AppRouter was importing and using many non-existent attorney pages.

**Solution:**
- Removed imports for all non-existent attorney pages
- Removed all protected attorney routes (dashboard, matters, invoices, proformas, notifications, profile, settings, login)
- Kept only two public attorney routes:
  - `/attorney/register` - for attorney registration via invitation
  - `/attorney/submit-matter-request` - for submitting matter requests
- Removed unused components: `AttorneyProtectedRoute`, `AttorneyNavigationBar`, `AttorneyLayout`

## Remaining Attorney Functionality

Per the Phase 1.5 Attorney Invitation Workflow implementation, only these attorney features remain:

1. **Attorney Registration** (`/attorney/register`)
   - Attorneys can register using an invitation token
   - Validates firm and token
   - Creates attorney user account

2. **Matter Request Submission** (`/attorney/submit-matter-request`)
   - Attorneys can submit matter requests
   - Includes document upload functionality
   - Requests appear in advocate's "New Requests" tab

## Files Modified

1. `src/pages/index.ts` - Fixed exports
2. `src/components/matters/DocumentsTab.tsx` - Removed document processing import
3. `src/AppRouter.tsx` - Cleaned up attorney routes and imports
4. `src/components/document-processing/DocumentUploadWithProcessing.tsx` - DELETED

## Next Steps

If you're still seeing errors:

1. **Clear browser cache** - Do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Restart dev server** - Stop and restart `npm run dev`
3. **Clear Vite cache** - Delete `node_modules/.vite` folder and restart

The build should now succeed without any missing import errors.
