# Email Confirmation Fix - Production Setup

## Problem Fixed
When users confirmed their email in production, they were being redirected to `localhost:3000` instead of your production domain, and no success message was shown.

## Changes Made

### 1. Auth Service (`src/services/auth.service.ts`)
- Updated `signUp()`, `signInWithMagicLink()`, and `resetPassword()` to use production URL
- Now uses `VITE_APP_URL` environment variable for redirects
- Falls back to `window.location.origin` if not set

### 2. Login Page (`src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`)
- Added email confirmation detection on page load
- Shows success message when `?confirmed=true` is in URL
- Automatically switches to sign-in mode
- Cleans up URL after showing message

### 3. Environment Configuration (`.env` and `.env.example`)
- Added `VITE_APP_URL` variable for production domain

## Required Setup Steps

### Step 1: Update Your `.env` File
Replace the placeholder with your actual production URL:

```bash
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-actual-domain.com
```

**Examples:**
- `VITE_APP_URL=https://lexo.co.za`
- `VITE_APP_URL=https://app.lexohub.com`
- `VITE_APP_URL=https://lexo-production.vercel.app`

### Step 2: Update Supabase Dashboard Settings

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
4. Update the **Redirect URLs** section:
   - Add: `https://your-actual-domain.com/#/login`
   - Add: `https://your-actual-domain.com/#/login?confirmed=true`
   - Add: `https://your-actual-domain.com/#/reset-password`

### Step 3: Rebuild and Deploy

```bash
# Rebuild your application with the new environment variable
npm run build

# Deploy to your hosting platform
# (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
```

### Step 4: Update Environment Variables on Hosting Platform

If you're using Vercel, Netlify, or another hosting platform:

1. Go to your project settings
2. Find Environment Variables section
3. Add: `VITE_APP_URL=https://your-actual-domain.com`
4. Redeploy

## What Users Will Experience Now

### Sign Up Flow:
1. User fills out sign-up form
2. Receives email with confirmation link
3. Clicks link → redirected to `https://your-domain.com/#/login?confirmed=true`
4. Sees success message: "✅ Email confirmed successfully! You can now sign in with your credentials."
5. Can immediately sign in

### Magic Link Flow:
1. User requests magic link
2. Receives email
3. Clicks link → redirected to `https://your-domain.com/#/login`
4. Automatically signed in

## Testing

### Local Testing:
```bash
# In .env, use your local URL
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Or for Vite dev server
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Production Testing:
1. Create a test account
2. Check email for confirmation link
3. Verify redirect goes to production domain
4. Confirm success message appears
5. Sign in successfully

## Troubleshooting

### Still redirecting to localhost?
- Check that `VITE_APP_URL` is set in your hosting platform's environment variables
- Verify you've rebuilt and redeployed after adding the variable
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Supabase error "Invalid redirect URL"?
- Make sure you've added the redirect URLs in Supabase Dashboard
- URLs must match exactly (including `/#/` for hash routing)
- Wait a few minutes for Supabase to update

### No success message showing?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the URL contains `?confirmed=true` parameter
- Try clearing browser cache

## Additional Notes

- The fix uses hash-based routing (`/#/login`) which works with single-page applications
- URL cleanup happens automatically after showing the success message
- The confirmation check runs only once on page load
- Works with both URL query parameters and hash parameters
