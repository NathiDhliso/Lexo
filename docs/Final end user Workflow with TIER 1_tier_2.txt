# Complete Workflow with TIER 1 & TIER 2 Features Integrated

## 🔒 **IMPORTANT: No Document Uploads**
This system does NOT store sensitive legal documents on servers. Instead:
- ✅ Attorneys can **link** to documents in their own cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox)
- ✅ You maintain complete control over sensitive materials
- ✅ Links are stored for reference, but documents stay in YOUR secure environment

## **Path A: "Quote First" Path (Complex Matters)**

### **Stage 1: PRO FORMA (The Estimate)**
```
Attorney submits brief → Matter status: "New Request" →
You → Open matter → Review brief details →
You → ProFormaRequestPage → Use Universal Toolset →
You → Add services → Build estimate → Generate PDF →
You → Send pro forma to attorney → Matter status: "Awaiting Approval" →
Attorney → Reviews estimate → Approves OR Declines →

IF APPROVED:
  Attorney → Approves estimate → Matter status: "Active" →
  You → Proceed with work →

IF DECLINED:
  Attorney → Declines estimate → Matter status: "Declined" →
  You → Matter archived →
```

**What the Brief Contains:**
```
STRUCTURED DATA (Required):
├─ Matter Title: "Contract Dispute - ABC Corp"
├─ Matter Type: [Opinion | Court Appearance | Drafting | Research]
├─ Practice Area: [Commercial | Labour | Tax | etc.]
├─ Brief Description: [Text area - attorney explains the issue]
├─ Deadline: [Date picker]
├─ Estimated Complexity: [Simple | Medium | Complex]
└─ Special Instructions: [Optional notes]

REFERENCE MATERIALS (Optional - External Links Only):
├─ Link to contract: https://drive.google.com/...
├─ Link to correspondence: https://onedrive.com/...
└─ Link to court papers: https://dropbox.com/...

Note: Documents stay in attorney's cloud storage.
You access them via links, not downloads from our system.
```

### **Stage 2: MATTERS/WIP (Detailed Tracking)**
```
You → MatterWorkbenchPage → Log time entries as work happens →
You → Log expenses → Log services → WIP value accumulates →

🔄 SCOPE AMENDMENT TRIGGER:
Attorney → Phones: "Can you also draft heads of argument?" →
You → MatterWorkbenchPage → Click "Request Scope Amendment" button →
You → Add new line items (e.g., "Draft heads of argument - 8 hours @ R2,500") →
You → System shows: Original estimate + Amendment = New total →
You → Send amendment request to attorney →
Attorney → Reviews → Approves OR Declines →

IF AMENDMENT APPROVED:
  Matter budget updates → You continue work with new scope →

IF AMENDMENT DECLINED:
  Work only on original scope → Amendment archived →

You → Track actual costs vs estimate (including amendments) →
You → Complete work → Mark matter ready for invoicing →

📊 WIP REPORT (Tier 2):
At any time → Navigate to Reports → WIP Report →
See: All active matters with unbilled work →
Shows: Matter name, hours logged, estimated value, days in WIP →
Helps you: "I have R45,000 in unbilled work across 6 matters" →
```

### **Stage 3: INVOICE (The Final Bill)**
```
You → InvoicesPage → Convert WIP to invoice →
You → System pulls all logged time/expenses/services → Generate invoice PDF →
You → Review invoice → Send to attorney → Invoice status: "Sent" →
You → Track payment status →

Attorney → Pays invoice → You mark as "Paid" → Matter closes →

📊 OUTSTANDING FEES REPORT (Tier 1):
Navigate to Reports → Outstanding Fees →
See: All unpaid invoices sorted by days overdue →
Shows: 
  - Smith & Associates | Matter: Contract dispute | R15,000 | 45 days overdue
  - Jones Inc | Matter: Opinion on tax | R8,500 | 12 days overdue
Use this to: Follow up on late payments, manage cashflow →

📊 REVENUE REPORT (Tier 1):
Navigate to Reports → Revenue →
See: Total fees earned per month/quarter/year →
Filter by: Date range, attorney firm, practice area →
Use for: SARS provisional tax, income tracking, year-end accounting →

💳 CREDIT NOTE SCENARIO:
Attorney → "There's an error, you charged 10 hours but we agreed on 8" →
You → InvoicesPage → Open invoice → Click "Issue Credit Note" →
You → Select reason: "Fee adjustment - hours correction" →
You → Enter credit amount: R5,000 →
System → Generates credit note PDF with proper SARS format →
System → Updates invoice: Original R25,000 - Credit R5,000 = Balance R20,000 →
You → Send credit note to attorney →
Outstanding Fees Report → Updates automatically to show R20,000 balance →
Revenue Report → Adjusts total revenue for that period →
```

---

## **Path B: "Accept & Work" Path (Traditional Brief Fee) - ENHANCED**

### **🚀 Scenario: Attorney Phones You Directly**

```
Ring ring! Attorney on the phone:
"Hi, I need an opinion on a restraint of trade clause. Can you help?"

You think: "This is straightforward, I don't need a formal pro forma."
You decide: Path B - Accept & Work immediately.
```

Instead of asking attorney to submit through portal, you capture the brief details yourself while on the call:

```
You → MattersPage → Click [+ Quick Brief Entry] →
System → Opens Quick Brief Questionnaire Modal →

## **Credit Notes Workflow (Detailed)**

### **Trigger Points:**
```
1. Fee dispute: "Your rate was supposed to be R2,000/hour not R2,500"
2. Calculation error: "You billed 12 hours but only worked 10"
3. Scope disagreement: "We didn't authorize the legal research"
4. Goodwill adjustment: "Client unhappy, reduce fee by 10%"
5. Disbursement correction: "We already paid for the transcript"
```

### **Process:**
```
You → InvoicesPage → Find the invoice →
You → Click invoice → Click "Issue Credit Note" button →
You → Credit Note Modal opens:
  - Reason dropdown: [Fee adjustment | Calculation error | Goodwill | Other]
  - Amount: R_____ (must be ≤ invoice total)
  - Notes: [Free text explanation]
  - Generate button →

System → Creates credit note record →
System → Generates PDF with:
  - Credit Note #CN-2025-001
  - Reference to original invoice
  - Reason for credit
  - Amount credited
  - New balance owing →

You → PDF downloads automatically →
You → Email credit note to attorney →

System → Updates:

```

### **Credit Note on Reports:**
```

  Smith & Associates | Contract dispute
  Original: R25,000
  Credit: -R5,000
  Balance: R20,000 ← This is what shows

## **Scope Amendments Workflow (Detailed)**

### **Trigger Scenario:**
```
You're 60% through a matter (logged 6 hours of 10 estimated)
Attorney phones: "Opposing counsel filed new papers, can you draft a reply?"
This wasn't in original scope → Need scope amendment
```

### **Process:**
```
You → MatterWorkbenchPage → Click "Request Scope Amendment" →
You → Amendment Modal opens:
  - Current pro forma shows (original services listed)
  - Button: "+ Add Additional Services" →

You → Add new line items:
  - "Draft replying affidavit" - 6 hours @ R2,500 = R15,000
  - "Court appearance (reply)" - 2 hours @ R3,000 = R6,000
  Total amendment: R21,000 →

You → Write note: "Additional work required due to opposing papers filed" →
You → Click "Send Amendment Request" →

System → Generates Amendment PDF showing:
  Original Pro Forma Total: R25,000
  + Amendment Services: R21,000
  = New Total: R46,000 →

System → Sends to attorney → Amendment status: "Pending Approval" →
You → Continue original work while waiting →

Attorney → Receives amendment → Reviews → Clicks "Approve" or "Decline" →

IF APPROVED:
  System → Updates matter budget to R46,000 →
  System → Matter status: "Active (Amended)" →
  You → Proceed with additional work →
  WIP tracking → Now compares against R46,000 budget →

IF DECLINED:
  System → Amendment marked "Declined" →
  You → Complete only original scope →
  You → Phone attorney: "What would you like me to do instead?" →
```

### **Multiple Amendments:**
```
A matter can have multiple amendments:
  Original: R25,000
  Amendment 1 (approved): +R21,000
  Amendment 2 (approved): +R8,000
  Total budget: R54,000

Matter page shows:
  "Original scope: R25,000"
  "Amendments: +R29,000"
  "Current budget: R54,000"
  "Work logged: R48,000"
  "Remaining: R6,000"
```

## **✅ System Philosophy:**

1. **Path A (Quote First):** For matters where you need attorney approval before investing time
2. **Path B (Accept & Work):** For matters where you know the scope and can bill afterward
3. **Quick Brief Capture:** Makes Path B as fast as a phone call (no paperwork bottleneck)
4. **Preconfigured Answers:** Learn your practice patterns, get faster over time
5. **No Document Uploads:** Keep sensitive materials in attorney's control, not your servers
6. **Automated Reports:** Financial visibility without spreadsheet maintenance

**The system adapts to how you actually work, not how software thinks you should work.**
