## 4. Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Matter Creation
1. User opens NewMatterMultiStep modal (5 steps with validation)
2. Captures: Basic Info → Client Details → Attorney Info → Financial Terms → Review
3. System validates and submits via matterApiService
4. Matter appears on MattersPage with active status

**MattersPage Focus (Streamlined 2025-10-06):**
- Case details and matter information only
- Matter status and health checks
- Basic WIP display (when applicable)
- Associated services display
- Search, filter, create, edit actions
- **Removed:** Invoice generation, ProForma links, complex financial summaries (moved to billing sections)
- **Result:** 34% code reduction, clearer separation of concerns

### Workflow 2: Pro Forma Generation
**Note:** All invoice generation features moved from MattersPage to dedicated Pro Forma and Invoice sections.

**Process:**
1. Advocate creates secure pro forma link (7-day expiry)
2. Attorney submits request via public form (no login required)
3. Request appears in PendingProFormaRequests with detailed summary
4. Advocate reviews and confirms via ConfirmDialog (prevents accidental actions)
5. System generates pro forma invoice with auto-calculated totals
6. Attorney receives notification and can accept/decline

**Invoice Generation Modal Features:**
- Tabbed interface: Time Entries, Expenses, Settings
- Invoice type selection: Final Invoice vs Pro Forma
- Discount configuration: Fixed amount ($) or Percentage (%)
- Fee structure override with default rate option
- AI-assisted fee narrative generation (Bar Council compliant)
- Real-time invoice summary panel with VAT calculations
- Warning for missing time entries or expenses
- Direct PDF generation and preview

**Full workflow details:** See `docs/end_to_end_billing_matter_workflow.md`

### Workflow 3: Invoice Conversion
1. Once pro forma accepted, advocate opens InvoiceGenerationModal
2. System auto-populates all data from pro forma
3. Advocate reviews, adjusts if needed, generates final invoice
4. System marks time entries as billed, updates matter WIP
5. PDF generated and sent to client
6. Invoice status transitions: draft → sent → paid

### Workflow 4: Payment Tracking
1. Monitor invoice status via InvoicesPage dashboard
2. Record payments via PaymentModal
3. System updates balance_due, marks invoice paid when complete
4. Automated reminder service schedules follow-ups for overdue invoices

---

## 5. Design System

### Color Coding
- **Matters:** Blue (`judicial-blue-500`)
- **Pro Forma:** Gold (`mpondo-gold-500`)
- **Invoices:** Green (`status-success-500`)

### Status Colors
- **Active/Sent/Accepted:** Green
- **Pending/Draft:** Gold
- **Declined/Overdue:** Red
- **Completed/Paid:** Gray

### Component Patterns
- All cards have 4px left border in document type color
- Status badges auto-color based on status value
- Workflow pipeline shows real-time counts with gold active state
- Multi-step forms display progress indicators
- Confirmation dialogs show detailed summaries before critical actions

### Branding
- **Primary:** Mpondo Gold (`#D4AF37`)
- **Secondary:** Judicial Blue (`#1E40AF`)
- **Success:** Green (`#10B981`)
- **Error:** Red (`#EF4444`)
- **Neutral:** Gray scale
