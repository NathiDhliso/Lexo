- Original files preserved in archive folders

### Step 2: Deploy Code Changes âœ…
**Files to Deploy:**
```bash
# New consolidated documentation
docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md
docs/FEATURE_INVENTORY.md
docs/IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md
docs/MIGRATION_CONSOLIDATION_LOG.md
docs/CONSOLIDATION_VALIDATION_REPORT.md
docs/CONSOLIDATION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md

# Updated service files
src/services/api/expenses.service.ts (compatibility layer)
src/services/api/disbursement.service.ts (VAT integration)

# Archive structure
docs/archive/ (all archived files)
supabase/migrations/archive/ (archived migrations)

# Validation and rollback scripts
scripts/consolidation-validation.js
scripts/rollback-consolidation.js
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment âœ…
**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Run consolidation validation
node scripts/consolidation-validation.js

# Verify TypeScript compilation
npm run type-check

# Run existing tests
npm run test
```

### Step 4: Monitor System Health âœ…
**Monitoring Points:**
- Service layer compatibility layer usage
- Any errors related to ExpensesService deprecation
- Documentation access patterns
- System performance metrics

## POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

### âœ… Functional Testing
- [ ] Verify ExpensesService compatibility layer works
- [ ] Test DisbursementService VAT integration
- [ ] Confirm documentation accessibility
- [ ] Validate archive structure integrity

### âœ… Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor service response times
- [ ] Check for any new error patterns
- [ ] Verify memory usage remains stable
- [ ] Confirm no performance degradation

### âœ… User Experience Validation
- [ ] Verify all existing functionality works
- [ ] Confirm no UI breaking changes
- [ ] Test critical user workflows
- [ ] Validate error messages and feedback

## ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### Automatic Rollback Script âœ…
```bash
# Full rollback of all consolidation changes
node scripts/rollback-consolidation.js all

# Specific rollback options
node scripts/rollback-consolidation.js migrations
node scripts/rollback-consolidation.js services
node scripts/rollback-consolidation.js documentation
```

### Manual Rollback Steps âœ…
1. **Restore Archived Migrations:**
   ```bash
   cp supabase/migrations/archive/*.sql supabase/migrations/
   ```

2. **Restore Original Services:**
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 src/services/api/expenses.service.ts
   git checkout HEAD~1 src/services/api/disbursement.service.ts
   ```

3. **Restore Original Documentation:**
   ```bash
   cp docs/archive/FEATURE_AUDIT_REPORT.md ./
   cp docs/archive/PRODUCTION_BLOCKERS_FIXED.md ./
   # ... restore other archived docs as needed
   ```

### Rollback Validation âœ…
```bash
# Verify rollback success
npm run type-check
npm run test
node scripts/consolidation-validation.js
```
