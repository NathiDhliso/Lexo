## 📞 Two Ways to Work

### Path A: Quote First (Complex Matters)
**When:** Uncertain scope, need approval before starting

```
Attorney submits brief → You review → Create pro forma estimate 
→ Send to attorney → They approve → You start work
```

**Example:** Large litigation, extensive research, multi-day court appearance

### Path B: Accept & Work (Routine Matters)
**When:** Known scope, standard brief fee

```
Attorney phones → You capture brief (2 min) → Accept immediately 
→ Do the work → Invoice after completion
```

**Example:** Standard opinion, consultation, single court appearance
