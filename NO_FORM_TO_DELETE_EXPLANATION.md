## 🎯 THE CONFUSION EXPLAINED

**The "Basic Information" form you're seeing is NOT wrong!**

That form is **correct** and should stay exactly as it is. Here's why:

## 📍 WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT

### The Screenshot Shows:
```
Basic Information
├─ Matter Title *
├─ Matter Type *  
├─ Court Case Number
└─ Description *
```

**This is:** `NewMatterWizardPage.tsx` - Step 1 of matter creation  
**Purpose:** Create a NEW matter (before it exists)  
**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT - KEEP THIS!**

**Why it's correct:**
- This is for creating new matters
- It doesn't handle documents at all
- Documents come AFTER matter is created
- This is not the Documents tab we fixed

## 🎯 WHAT TO TEST

### ❌ DON'T Test Here (What You're Looking At)
- **Page:** New Matter Wizard
- **Form:** "Basic Information"
- **Why:** This is matter creation, not document management

### ✅ DO Test Here (What You Need)
- **Page:** Matter Workbench OR Matter Detail Modal

## 💡 WHERE THE FIX ACTUALLY IS

Remember, the fix we did today was in these files:

### ✅ Fixed Files
1. `MatterWorkbenchPage.tsx` - Changed import to use correct DocumentsTab
2. `MatterDetailModal.tsx` - Verified already using correct DocumentsTab

### ✅ Correct Component
- `src/components/documents/DocumentsTab.tsx` - Privacy-first system

### ❌ Old Component (Deprecated)
- `src/components/matters/DocumentsTab.tsx` - Upload-based (no longer used)

### 🟢 Unchanged (Correct As-Is)
- `NewMatterWizardPage.tsx` - Matter creation form (what you're seeing)
