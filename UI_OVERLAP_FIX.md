# UI Overlap Fix - Login Page

## Issue
The "SIGN UP" heading text was overlapping with the "Password" label in the desktop signup form, causing a visual layout problem.

## Root Cause
The signup form inputs were missing proper label wrappers (`<div className="space-y-1">`), unlike the login form which had them. This caused:
- No proper spacing between the heading and form fields
- Text overlap between "SIGN UP" and form labels
- Inconsistent layout between login and signup panels

## Solution
Updated the desktop signup form to match the login form structure by:

1. **Added label wrappers** for each input field:
   ```tsx
   <div className="space-y-1">
     <label htmlFor="desktop-fullName" className="block text-xs font-medium text-white/90 pl-1">Full Name</label>
     <input ... />
   </div>
   ```

2. **Added proper labels** for all fields:
   - Full Name
   - Email
   - Password
   - Confirm Password

3. **Updated input styling** to match login form:
   - Changed from `bg-white/40` to `bg-white/95` for better readability
   - Updated border styles for consistency
   - Improved focus states with `focus:ring-green-500`

4. **Improved placeholders**:
   - "Enter your full name" instead of "Full Name"
   - "Enter your email" instead of "Email"
   - "Create a password" instead of "New Password"
   - "Confirm your password" instead of "Confirm Password"

## Changes Made

### File: `src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
<input
  id="desktop-fullName"
  type="text"
  placeholder="Full Name"
  className="w-full ... bg-white/40 ..."
  ...
/>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="space-y-1">
  <label htmlFor="desktop-fullName" className="block text-xs font-medium text-white/90 pl-1">
    Full Name
  </label>
  <input
    id="desktop-fullName"
    type="text"
    placeholder="Enter your full name"
    className="w-full ... bg-white/95 ..."
    ...
  />
</div>
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **No more text overlap** - Proper spacing between heading and form
2. ✅ **Consistent UI** - Signup form now matches login form structure
3. ✅ **Better accessibility** - Proper label associations for screen readers
4. ✅ **Improved readability** - Better contrast with `bg-white/95`
5. ✅ **Better UX** - Clear labels help users understand what to enter

## Testing

Test the fix by:
1. Open the login page in desktop view (width > 1024px)
2. Click on the "Sign Up" toggle
3. Verify:
   - "SIGN UP" heading is clearly visible at the top
   - All form labels are visible and not overlapping
   - Proper spacing between all elements
   - Form is easy to read and use
