- Support for both Pro Forma estimates (`is_estimate=true`) and WIP actuals (`is_estimate=false`)
- Full RLS policies preventing modification of invoiced items
- Proper indexes for all query patterns

**Service Layer:**

## üöÄ Ready for Integration

The foundation is complete. The next phase involves integrating these components into the existing pipeline:

### Critical Path Forward (Priority Order)

#### 1. Pro Forma Integration (Phase 3, Tasks 5.1-5.3)
**Goal:** Replace current Pro Forma line item system with universal toolset

**Tasks:**
- Add three buttons to ProFormaRequestPage: "Add Service", "Add Time", "Add Expense"
- Wire buttons to open respective modals with `isEstimate=true`
- Display all three types of line items
- Update proforma-pdf.service.ts to fetch from all three tables

**Impact:** Pro Forma estimates will use the same logging system as WIP

#### 2. WIP Accumulator Refactor (Phase 3, Task 7.1)
**Goal:** Calculate WIP from all three sources

**Tasks:**
- Update WIPAccumulator to query logged_services, time_entries, expenses
- Calculate separate totals for each type
- Display breakdown and grand total

**Impact:** Accurate WIP calculation across all work types

#### 3. Invoice Generation Refactor (Phase 3, Tasks 7.3-7.5)
**Goal:** Enforce atomic rule - invoices only from WIP, never from estimates

**Tasks:**
- Remove Pro Forma data fetching from GenerateInvoiceModal
- Remove Pro Forma data fetching from UnifiedInvoiceWizard
- Update invoice-pdf.service.ts to accept line items as parameters
- Mark WIP items as invoiced after generation

**Impact:** Invoices will accurately reflect actual work performed

#### 4. Matter WIP Tracking UI (Phase 3, Tasks 6.1-6.4)
**Goal:** Tabbed interface for logging actual work

**Tasks:**
- Refactor MatterDetailsInvoicing with tabs (Services, Time, Expenses)
- Add "Log" buttons in each tab
- Wire to universal toolset modals with `isEstimate=false`
- Display logged items in each tab

**Impact:** Clean UI for tracking all WIP types

## üîß Technical Notes

### Database Migrations
Three migrations are ready but **NOT YET EXECUTED**:
1. `20250115000001_create_firms_table.sql`
2. `20250115000002_add_firm_id_to_matters.sql`
3. `20250115000003_create_logged_services_table.sql`

**To execute:**
```bash
# Run migrations in Supabase
supabase db push

# Or apply manually through Supabase dashboard
```

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ No broken imports
- ‚úÖ Consistent patterns across components
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling
- ‚úÖ User feedback via toasts
- ‚úÖ RLS policies for security

### Testing Status

## üí° Key Design Decisions

### 1. Dual-Purpose logged_services Table
**Decision:** Use single table with `is_estimate` flag instead of separate tables

**Rationale:**
- Reduces code duplication
- Easier to convert estimates to actuals
- Maintains traceability via `pro_forma_id`
- Simpler queries and maintenance

### 2. Automatic Amount Calculation
**Decision:** Database trigger calculates `amount = unit_rate √ó quantity`

**Rationale:**
- Ensures data consistency
- Prevents calculation errors
- Simplifies application code
- Atomic operation

### 3. Comprehensive WIP Calculation
**Decision:** WIP calculation includes all three sources in one query

**Rationale:**
- Single source of truth
- Accurate totals
- Efficient database operations
- Supports atomic rule enforcement

### 4. Modal Component Reuse
**Decision:** Adapt TimeEntryModal pattern for LogServiceModal

**Rationale:**
- Proven, tested pattern
- Consistent user experience
- Faster development
- Easier maintenance

4. **Type Safety:** TypeScript interfaces caught errors early

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Scope Management:** Deferred non-critical tasks to focus on core functionality
2. **Pattern Consistency:** Maintained consistent patterns across all new components
3. **RLS Complexity:** Carefully designed policies to prevent unauthorized access
