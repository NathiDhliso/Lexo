## Workflow Options

LexoHub now offers flexible workflow options to match how you work:

### 1. Traditional 3-Step Workflow (Recommended for New Clients)
```
PRO FORMA (Quote) â†’ MATTER (Case) â†’ INVOICE (Billing)
```
- **Best for**: New clients, complex matters, or when you need formal quotes
- **Benefits**: Clear documentation, professional presentation, and structured process

### 2. Direct Matter Creation (New!)
```
QUICK MATTER â†’ WORK â†’ INVOICE
```
- **Best for**: Urgent matters, existing clients, or when a formal quote isn't required
- **Benefits**: Faster setup, immediate work start, less administrative overhead

### 3. Brief-Based Workflow (New!)
```
MATTER â†’ MULTIPLE BRIEFS â†’ INVOICE
```
- **Best for**: Complex cases with multiple instructions over time
- **Benefits**: Track individual briefs within a single matter, each with its own fees and deadlines

### Why These Options?

1. **Flexibility**: Choose the right workflow for each situation
2. **Efficiency**: Save time when formal quotes aren't needed
3. **Accuracy**: Track multiple briefs within a single matter
4. **Control**: Maintain proper documentation regardless of workflow

**Tip**: You can still use the traditional pro forma process when needed, but it's no longer required for every matter.
