# Bulk Actions Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented bulk action functionality for Matters and Invoices pages using the BulkActionToolbar component.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Matters Page (`src/pages/MattersPage.tsx`)

**Actions:**
```typescript
- Archive: Changes matter status to CLOSED

- Delete: Permanently deletes matters from database with confirmation
```

**Integration:**
- Uses `useSelection` hook for managing selected items
- Uses `useConfirmation` hook for confirmation dialogs
- Integrates with existing `matterApiService` for updates
- Uses `exportToCSV` and `exportToPDF` utilities

- Delete: Permanently deletes invoices from database with confirmation
```

**Integration:**
- Uses `useSelection` hook for managing selected items
- Integrates with existing `InvoiceService` for operations
- Uses `exportToCSV` utility for data export

### 3. BulkActionToolbar Component (`src/components/ui/BulkActionToolbar.tsx`)

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Updated placeholder actions to use `console.warn` with clear messaging
- ✅ Clarified that default actions are examples only
- ✅ Component properly accepts custom actions via props

## User Experience

### How It Works:

1. **Selection**
   - Users can click checkboxes on individual items to select them
   - Selected count is displayed in the toolbar

2. **Bulk Actions**
   - Toolbar appears automatically when items are selected
   - Shows number of selected items (e.g., "3 of 15 selected")
   - Provides action buttons based on context

3. **Confirmation**
   - Destructive actions (Delete) require confirmation
   - Shows clear messages about what will happen
   - Provides success/error feedback via toasts

4. **Feedback**
   - Loading toasts during operations
   - Success messages with counts
   - Error messages if operations fail
   - Automatic list refresh after operations

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added:
- `useSelection` - Manages multi-select state
- `useConfirmation` - Handles confirmation dialogs
- `BulkActionToolbar` - Displays bulk action UI
- `SelectionCheckbox` - Individual item selection
- `exportToCSV` / `exportToPDF` - Data export utilities

### Key Features:
