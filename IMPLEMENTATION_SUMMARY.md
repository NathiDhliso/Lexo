## Migration Notes

### From Hash-Based to URL-Based Routing
- Previous: `#/matters`, `#/invoices`
- Current: `/matters`, `/invoices`
- All navigation now uses React Router's `useNavigate` hook
- Backward compatible with existing state-based navigation where needed

### Maintained Compatibility
- Existing pages still work with optional `onNavigate` prop
- Public routes (pro forma, engagement signing) still functional
- Protected routes use existing `ProtectedRoute` component

## Next Steps

1. Add database integration for all new features
2. Implement real notification system with WebSockets/polling
3. Add actual PDF generation for credit notes and reports
4. Implement real authentication for attorney portal
5. Add email notifications for disputes and approvals
6. Implement file upload for dispute supporting documents
7. Add data persistence for all forms
8. Implement proper error handling and validation
9. Add loading states for async operations
10. Create comprehensive unit tests for new components
