# Three Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed three issues in the application:
1. ✅ View Matter button not working
2. ✅ PDF upload feature (already exists in Documents tab)
3. ✅ Dark mode not working in Subscription & Billing

---

## 1. View Matter Button Fix

### Problem
The "View Matter" button on matter cards was not working - clicking it did nothing.

### Root Cause
The `MatterCard` component was calling `onViewDetails` prop, but the `MattersPage` component wasn't passing this handler.

### Solution
Added the missing `handleViewDetails` function in `MattersPage.tsx`:

```typescript
const handleViewDetails = (matter: Matter) => {
  setSelectedMatter(matter);
  setShowDetailModal(true);
};
```

### File Changed
- `src/pages/MattersPage.tsx`

### Result
✅ "View Matter" button now opens the matter detail modal correctly

---

## 2. PDF Upload Feature

### Status
✅ **Already Implemented!**

### Location
The PDF upload feature is already available in the Matter Detail Modal under the "Documents" tab.

### Features Available
- Upload documents (PDF, Word, images, etc.)
- View uploaded documents
- Download documents
- Delete documents
- Document processing with AI extraction
- File size and upload date display

### How to Access
1. Click "View" on any matter card
2. Click the "Documents" tab in the modal
3. Click "Upload Document" button
4. Select file and upload

### Component
- `src/components/matters/DocumentsTab.tsx`
- Uses `DocumentUploadWithProcessing` component for AI-powered document processing

## 3. Dark Mode Fix for Subscription & Billing

### Problem
The Subscription Management page was not respecting dark mode - text and backgrounds remained light even in dark mode.

### Root Cause
The component was using hardcoded `gray-*` classes instead of theme-aware `neutral-*` and `metallic-gray-*` classes with dark mode variants.

### Solution
Updated all color classes to support dark mode:

**Before:**
```typescript
className="bg-white text-gray-900"
className="border-gray-200"
className="text-gray-600"
```

**After:**
```typescript
className="bg-white dark:bg-metallic-gray-800 text-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-100"
className="border-neutral-200 dark:border-metallic-gray-700"
className="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400"
```

### Changes Made

#### Current Subscription Card
- Background: `bg-white dark:bg-metallic-gray-800`
- Border: `border-neutral-200 dark:border-metallic-gray-700`
- Text: `text-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-100`
- Labels: `text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400`

#### Usage Metrics Card
- Same dark mode classes as subscription card
- Consistent styling across all sections

#### Available Plans Section
- Header: `text-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-100`

#### Payment Gateway Selection Modal
- Labels: `text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300`
- Buttons: `border-neutral-200 dark:border-metallic-gray-600`
- Selected state: `bg-mpondo-gold-50 dark:bg-mpondo-gold-900/20`
- Hover state: `hover:border-mpondo-gold-300 dark:hover:border-mpondo-gold-700`
- Text: `text-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-100`
- Descriptions: `text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400`

### File Changed
- `src/components/subscription/SubscriptionManagement.tsx`

### Result
✅ Subscription page now fully supports dark mode
✅ All text is readable in both light and dark modes
✅ Consistent with the rest of the application's dark mode styling

## Additional Notes

### Dark Mode Color Scheme
The application uses a consistent color scheme:
- **Neutral colors**: `neutral-*` for general text and backgrounds
- **Metallic gray**: `metallic-gray-*` for dark mode backgrounds
- **Mpondo gold**: `mpondo-gold-*` for primary actions and highlights
- **Status colors**: `status-error-*`, `status-success-*`, etc.

### Best Practices Applied
1. Always use theme-aware classes with `dark:` variants
2. Use `neutral-*` instead of `gray-*` for consistency
3. Use `metallic-gray-*` for dark mode backgrounds
4. Ensure sufficient contrast in both modes
5. Test all interactive elements in both modes

## Summary

All three issues have been resolved:
1. ✅ View Matter button now works correctly
2. ✅ PDF upload feature confirmed working (already implemented)
3. ✅ Dark mode fully functional in Subscription & Billing

The application now provides a consistent, accessible experience in both light and dark modes!
