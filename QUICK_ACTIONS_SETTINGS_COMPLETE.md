# Quick Actions Settings Implementation

## Summary
Successfully moved Quick Actions configuration to the Settings page, allowing users to customize their quick actions menu without relying solely on the navbar placement.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: QuickActionsSettings
**File**: `src/components/settings/QuickActionsSettings.tsx`

Features:
- ✅ View all available quick actions
- ✅ Enable/disable individual actions
- ✅ Reorder actions by priority (move up/down)
- ✅ View usage statistics for each action
- ✅ Reset to default configuration
- ✅ Keyboard shortcut reference
- ✅ Usage analytics (total uses, most used action, etc.)
- ✅ Persistent storage using localStorage

### 2. Updated Settings Page
**File**: `src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`

Changes:
- Added "Quick Actions" tab with Zap icon
- Positioned as second tab (after Profile, before Subscription)
- Integrated QuickActionsSettings component

### 3. Enhanced QuickActionsMenu
**File**: `src/components/navigation/QuickActionsMenu.tsx`

Improvements:
- Now loads actions from localStorage (user preferences)
- Respects enabled/disabled state from settings
- Tracks usage count and syncs to localStorage
- Falls back to defaults if no saved preferences exist
- Maintains order set by user in settings

### 4. Type System Update
**File**: `src/types/index.ts`

Added:
- `isEnabled?: boolean` property to QuickAction interface

## User Benefits

### Industry Best Practice: Settings-Based Configuration
Instead of hardcoded quick actions in the navbar, users can now:

1. **Customize Actions**: Enable only the actions they use frequently
2. **Prioritize Workflow**: Reorder actions to match their workflow
3. **Track Usage**: See which actions they use most
4. **Clean Interface**: Disable unused actions to reduce clutter
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick reference for all shortcuts in one place

### Settings Location
Navigate to: **Settings → Quick Actions** (second tab)

## Features

### Action Management
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle visibility with eye icon
- **Reorder**: Use up/down arrows to change priority
- **Reset**: Restore default configuration anytime

### Usage Statistics Dashboard
- Total Quick Actions count
- Enabled Actions count
- Total Uses across all actions
- Most Used action highlight

### Keyboard Shortcuts
All actions maintain their keyboard shortcuts:
- `Ctrl+Shift+N` - Open Quick Actions menu
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` - Create Pro Forma
- `Ctrl+Shift+M` - New Matter
- `Ctrl+Shift+A` - Analyze Brief
- `Ctrl+Shift+I` - Quick Invoice

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. User configures actions in Settings
2. Configuration saved to localStorage as JSON
3. QuickActionsMenu loads from localStorage on mount
4. Usage counts updated in real-time
5. Changes persist across sessions

### Storage Structure
```json
[
  {
    "id": "create-proforma",
    "label": "Create Pro Forma",
    "description": "Generate a new pro forma invoice",
    "icon": "FileText",
    "shortcut": "Ctrl+Shift+P",
    "page": "proforma-requests",
    "minTier": "junior_start",
    "usageCount": 15,
    "lastUsed": "2025-01-27T10:30:00Z",
    "isEnabled": true
  }
]
```

### Icon Mapping
Icons are stored as strings in localStorage and mapped back to components:
- FileText → lucide-react FileText component
- FolderPlus → lucide-react FolderPlus component
- Brain → lucide-react Brain component
- Receipt → lucide-react Receipt component

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Custom Actions**: Allow users to create their own quick actions
2. **Cloud Sync**: Sync preferences across devices via Supabase
3. **Action Templates**: Pre-configured action sets for different roles
4. **Analytics**: Detailed usage analytics and recommendations
5. **Shortcuts Customization**: Allow users to change keyboard shortcuts
6. **Action Categories**: Group actions by type (Financial, Matters, Documents)
