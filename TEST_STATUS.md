## 📝 Recommendations

1. **Focus on Implemented Features**: The smoke tests and basic authentication tests are passing, which validates your core functionality.

2. **Incremental Testing**: As you implement each feature, update the corresponding test file to match your actual UI and navigation patterns.

3. **Update Tests to Match Your Architecture**: Your app uses:
   - State-based navigation (not URL routes)
   - Specific button/element names
   - Different data structures than the tests expect

4. **Test Data Setup**: Before running feature tests, you'll need to:
   - Create test matters, clients, invoices in the database
   - Set up proper test data fixtures
   - Ensure UI elements have proper test IDs or accessible names

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Run only the working tests: `npx playwright test tests/00-smoke-test.spec.ts tests/01-authentication.spec.ts --project=chromium`
2. As you build features, update corresponding test files
3. Use the smoke tests as a template for writing new tests that match your app's architecture
