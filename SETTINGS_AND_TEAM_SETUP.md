## 🔢 Team Member Limits by Tier

|------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Admission** | 1 | Not available |
| **Advocate** | 1 | R149/user/month |
| **Senior Counsel** | 5 | R99/user/month |

## 📊 Database Tables Created

### `team_members`
Stores team member invitations and memberships:
- Organization ID (owner)
- User ID (once accepted)
- Email, name, role
- Status (pending/active/inactive)
- Invitation tracking

### `user_profiles`
Stores extended user profile information:
- Personal details
- Practice information
- Address
- Avatar URL

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Run the team members migration
supabase db push

# Or manually run:
# supabase/migrations/20250110_team_members.sql
```

### 2. Access Settings

The Settings page is already integrated! Just:
1. Click your profile icon (top-right)
2. Click "Settings"
3. Navigate to any tab

### 3. Test Team Management

1. Go to Settings → Team Members
2. Click "Invite Member"
3. Fill in email, name, and role
4. Send invitation
5. Team member receives email (you'll need to implement email sending)

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Invite a Secretary

```typescript
// In TeamManagement component
1. Click "Invite Member"
2. Enter: secretary@example.com
3. Name: Jane Doe
4. Role: Secretary
5. Click "Send Invitation"
```

### Check Team Limits

```typescript
import { useSubscription } from './hooks/useSubscription';

const { subscription, usage } = useSubscription();

// Current users
const currentUsers = usage?.users_count || 1;

// Max allowed
const maxUsers = subscription?.tier === 'senior_counsel' ? 5 : 1;
const additionalUsers = subscription?.additional_users || 0;
const totalAllowed = maxUsers + additionalUsers;
```

### Upgrade for More Users

If you hit the team member limit:
1. Go to Settings → Subscription & Billing
2. Click "Upgrade" on a higher tier
3. Or add additional users to your current tier

## 🔒 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only see their own team members
- Organization owners control team membership
- Team members can only access their organization's data

### Automatic Limit Enforcement
- Database trigger prevents exceeding team limits
- Frontend validation before sending invitations
- Graceful upgrade prompts when limits reached

## 📧 Email Invitations

Team member invitations are created in the database. You'll need to implement email sending:

```typescript
// Example email service integration
async function sendInvitationEmail(email: string, firstName: string, inviteLink: string) {
  // Use your email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
  await emailService.send({
    to: email,
    subject: 'You\'ve been invited to join LexoHub',
    template: 'team-invitation',
    data: {
      firstName,
      inviteLink,
      organizationName: 'Your Practice'
    }
  });
}
```
