# Input Field Fix Applied

## Problem
Form inputs in the "Invite Team Member" modal were only typing one letter at a time, then losing focus.

## Root Cause
The component was using a single state object (`inviteData`) and spreading it on every keystroke:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Creates new object reference on every keystroke
onChange={(e) => setInviteData({ ...inviteData, email: e.target.value })}
```

This pattern can cause React to lose track of the input focus because the entire state object is being recreated.

## Solution
Split the single state object into individual state variables:

```typescript
// ✅ FIXED - Each field has its own state
const [inviteEmail, setInviteEmail] = useState('');
const [inviteFirstName, setInviteFirstName] = useState('');
const [inviteLastName, setInviteLastName] = useState('');
const [inviteRole, setInviteRole] = useState<'admin' | 'secretary' | 'advocate'>('secretary');

// Now each input updates only its own state
onChange={(e) => setInviteEmail(e.target.value)}
```

## Changes Made

### File: `src/components/settings/TeamManagement.tsx`

1. **Replaced single state object with individual states**
   - `inviteData.email` → `inviteEmail`
   - `inviteData.first_name` → `inviteFirstName`
   - `inviteData.last_name` → `inviteLastName`
   - `inviteData.role` → `inviteRole`

2. **Updated all onChange handlers**
   - Direct state updates instead of object spreading
   - Each input now has its own dedicated setter

3. **Updated handleInvite function**
   - Uses individual state variables
   - Resets each field individually after successful invite

## Result
✅ Inputs now work normally - you can type continuously without losing focus
✅ No performance issues
✅ Cleaner, more maintainable code
✅ Better React best practices

## Testing
1. Open Team Management
2. Click "Invite Member"
3. Type in any field - should work smoothly now
4. All fields should maintain focus while typing

## Why This Happens
When you spread an object in state (`{...inviteData, email: value}`), React sees it as a completely new object. If the component re-renders during typing (which it does), React may lose track of which input should have focus. Using individual state variables avoids this issue entirely.
