### Implementation Plan

**File to Edit**: `src/services/invoice-pdf.service.ts`

**Add After Line Items Section**:
```typescript
// Fetch scope amendments for this invoice's matter
const { data: amendments } = await supabase
  .from('scope_amendments')
  .select('*')
  .eq('matter_id', invoice.matter_id)
  .eq('status', 'approved')
  .order('approved_at', { ascending: true });

if (amendments && amendments.length > 0) {
  // Add Scope Amendments section
  yPosition += 15;
  doc.setFontSize(14);
  doc.setFont('helvetica', 'bold');
  doc.setTextColor(primaryColor[0], primaryColor[1], primaryColor[2]);
  doc.text('Scope Amendments', leftContentMargin, yPosition);
  yPosition += 10;

  amendments.forEach((amendment, index) => {
    // Amendment header
    doc.setFontSize(11);
    doc.setFont('helvetica', 'bold');
    doc.text(`Amendment ${index + 1}:`, leftContentMargin, yPosition);
    doc.setFont('helvetica', 'normal');
    yPosition += 6;

    // Reason
    doc.setFontSize(10);
    doc.text(`Reason: ${amendment.reason}`, leftContentMargin + 5, yPosition);
    yPosition += 6;

    // Description (multi-line)
    const descriptionLines = doc.splitTextToSize(
      amendment.description || '',
      contentWidth - 10
    );
    doc.text(descriptionLines, leftContentMargin + 5, yPosition);
    yPosition += descriptionLines.length * 6;

    // Cost details
    doc.text(
      `Original Estimate: ${formatRand(amendment.original_estimate || 0)}`,
      leftContentMargin + 5,
      yPosition
    );
    yPosition += 6;
    doc.text(
      `Amendment Total: ${formatRand(amendment.variance_amount || 0)}`,
      leftContentMargin + 5,
      yPosition
    );
    yPosition += 6;
    doc.setFont('helvetica', 'bold');
    doc.text(
      `New Total: ${formatRand(amendment.new_estimate || 0)}`,
      leftContentMargin + 5,
      yPosition
    );
    yPosition += 12;

    // Check for new page
    if (yPosition > pageHeight - 40) {
      doc.addPage();
      yPosition = margins.top;
    }
  });
