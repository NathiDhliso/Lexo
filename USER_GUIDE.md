## Getting Started

### What is LexoHub?

LexoHub is a comprehensive practice management system that helps advocates manage their entire workflow from initial client quotes through to final payment collection. The system is designed around South African legal practices with built-in VAT calculations, Bar-compliant formatting, and local currency support.

### First Login

When you first log in, you'll see your Dashboard with quick access to all major features. The navigation bar at the top provides access to:
- **Dashboard** - Your practice overview
- **Pro Forma** - Quote management
- **Matters** - Active case management
- **Invoices** - Billing and payments
- **Reports** - Analytics and insights
- **Profile** - Your professional information
- **Settings** - System configuration

---

## The 3-Step Workflow

LexoHub follows a structured 3-step workflow that ensures proper documentation and billing:

```
Step 1: PRO FORMA (Quote) â†’ Step 2: MATTER (Case) â†’ Step 3: INVOICE (Billing)
```

### Why This Workflow?

1. **Pro Forma First**: Always start with a quote to set client expectations
2. **Matter Conversion**: Accepted quotes become active matters
3. **Automated Billing**: All work is tracked and automatically flows into invoices

**Important**: You cannot create matters directly - they must be converted from accepted pro forma requests.

A: The system tracks all time entries and expenses linked to the matter, providing complete documentation for dispute resolution.

**Q: Can I reverse a matter conversion?**
A: Yes, use the "Reverse" button on the matter. This will delete the matter and restore the pro forma to "Accepted" status.
