## Critical Path Forward
The most important remaining tasks for a functional MVP:
1. Create LogServiceModal component (Phase 2, task 4.1)
2. Integrate three modals into Pro Forma page (Phase 3, task 5.1)
3. Refactor WIPAccumulator for multi-source calculation (Phase 3, task 7.1)
4. Update invoice generation to use WIP only (Phase 3, task 7.3-7.5)

## Deferred Tasks (Can be completed later)
- Matter workbench firm selection integration
- Documents tab cloud linking
- Schema documentation updates
- Optional testing tasks
- Data migration scripts (run after core functionality is tested)
